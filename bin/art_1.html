<p>Welcome to the <i>Computers and Satellites</i> column of <i>Satellite 
Times</i>. We are about to embark on an adventure of discovery&mdash;an 
adventure I have been looking forward to for quite some time. I only hope you 
will enjoy the experience as much as I and want to follow along with each new 
episode.</p>

<p>Along the way, I hope to enlighten you, the reader&mdash;whether novice or 
expert&mdash;on the subtleties involved in the theory and practical application 
of computers to the process of tracking satellites in earth orbit. Whether you 
simply want to be able to know where to point your TVRO antenna to pick up your 
favorite television shows, are curious as to where to look to see the Mir space 
station on a twilight pass, or want to know when you will be able to DX with the 
space shuttle on the next SAREX mission, we'll cover it all.</p>

<p>We'll start with some of the basics of orbital propagation (just a fancy way 
of saying 'predicting where a satellite is going to be') to give you not only an 
appreciation for why certain orbital models are used but why it is important to 
use the proper data with those models. Next, we'll talk about the various 
choices of coordinate systems so that we can be sure we're all talking about the 
same thing and we'll cover the necessary coordinate transformations to move back 
and forth among these systems, throwing in an equation or two from time to time 
to keep things honest. Naturally, I'll include snippets of computer code to 
illustrate the process and help you build your own algorithmic tool chest.</p>

<p>From time to time, I'll review available computer software which can make it 
easier for you accomplish your satellite tracking tasks&mdash;from commercial 
products to the finest in public domain software. I'll share information on good 
places to look to find satellite-related information&mdash;both on dial-up BBSs 
and out on the Information Superhighway. And, of course, we'll cover timely 
sources for orbital element sets, without which none of us would be able to 
track satellites.</p>

<p>As your tour guide on this adventure, I'll do my best to anticipate some of 
the more common questions: How are orbital element sets generated? How often 
should I get new data? Why do the individual modules of the Mir space station 
have separate element sets when they are physically docked together? Why can't I 
find a two-line element set for the sun or the moon? We'll answer these and many 
more. But for you to get the most out of this experience, you must participate, 
too. I want you to feel free to ask questions as we go along. I'll do my best to 
answer each and every one of them. I look forward to hearing from you.</p>

<p>Now, let's get down to the topic of this column: Orbital Propagation. 
Although the fundamental concepts of how objects move under gravitational 
attraction has been understood since the time of Isaac Newton, the practical 
determination of an object's position in orbit is considerably more difficult. 
In order to be able to select the best method of orbital propagation, it is 
important that we understand why this is so.</p>

<p>According to Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, the gravitational 
attraction between two objects is directly proportional to the product of their 
masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. 
Newton's genius allowed him to deduce this law as the common explanation for why 
an apple drops to the ground and the moon orbits the earth.</p>

<p>To fully appreciate the implications of this law, we must first develop a 
model to demonstrate it. A model is simply any representation of some or all of 
the properties of a system. In this case, our system is two objects and the 
gravitational force between them (as defined by Newton's Law). For the purpose 
of this discussion, we will confine ourselves to mathematical models, wherein 
our representation of the system is described via mathematical equations or 
computer algorithms. If our two objects are simple point masses, the result of 
this model will be that the two objects will orbit about their common center of 
mass moving in elliptical orbits (given the appropriate starting conditions). If 
one object is considerably more massive than the other, it will appear that the 
smaller object is following an elliptical orbit around the more massive 
object.</p>

<p>In a real system, things can become considerably more complicated. Since we 
are primarily interested in the motion of an artificial satellite around the 
earth, let's consider that as our system. The primary force affecting the motion 
of our satellite is still gravitational attraction. However, now we must 
consider many additional perturbing forces, or perturbations, if we want to be 
able to accurately predict the position of the satellite. These additional 
forces will act to change our satellite's orbital path from that of a true 
ellipse. Knowing which perturbations have the most significant effects and under 
what conditions will be extremely important.</p>

<p>What are some of these perturbing forces? Let's begin with just the 
gravitational ones. In our simple model, we assumed our two objects were point 
masses. The earth, however, is not a point mass. If the earth were perfectly 
spherical and had a uniform density, however, it would still be possible to 
treat it as a point mass (it is possible to prove this mathematically). But the 
earth is not spherical&mdash;it bulges at the equator, primarily due to the 
centrifugal force of its own rotation. Neither does it have uniform density. It 
is enveloped with oceans which bulge under the tidal forces of the sun and the 
moon. The lighter material of the continents 'floats' on the denser mantle. 
While Newton's Law still applies, it is now necessary to consider the 
gravitational effect of each individual 'piece' of the earth on our satellite. 
All of a sudden, our simple model has become a lot more complicated.</p>

<p>We also assumed that there were only two gravitational masses in our original 
model. We cannot, however, ignore the gravitational effects of the sun and the 
moon, though. And what about the gravitational effects of the planets? Are these 
to be considered significant, too?</p>

<p>There are non-gravitational forces to consider, as well. The primary one, for 
some classes of earth orbits, is atmospheric drag. Ignoring this perturbation 
for a low-earth orbit will result in significant errors. Even tiny forces, such 
as solar radiation pressure, can have a significant effect on a satellite's 
orbit under the proper conditions.</p>

<p>Our discussion, to this point, has been purely theoretical. We started with a 
simple model of gravitation and developed a realization that the real world is 
more complex (no real surprise here). But since the subject of this column is 
<i>computers</i> and satellites, we must develop a mathematical model of an 
artificial satellite's orbital motion which trades off the accuracy of an 
extremely complex description of our system against the reduced computational 
burden of a simpler description. Remember, a model is simply any representation 
of <i>some</i> or all of the properties of a system&mdash;a good model only 
selects those properties necessary to achieve the desired degree of 
accuracy.</p>

<p>Before considering just what effects are most significant for modeling the 
orbit of an artificial earth satellite, there is another issue that must be 
addressed from a computational perspective. Up to this point, I have implied 
that if we knew the current state of a satellite's orbit&mdash;for our purposes, 
the satellite's position and velocity&mdash;and the forces acting upon it, we 
could determine the satellite's state at some future (or past) time. This 
suggestion is true, regardless of the complexity of the model of our forces. 
However, if our model is too simple or we take too big of steps (in time), the 
accuracy of our results will suffer.</p>

<p>Even if we choose the proper level of modeling complexity and the proper size 
time steps, though, we are faced with one inescapable conclusion resulting from 
this approach. That conclusion is that if we are given a particular set of 
starting conditions for our satellite orbit&mdash;generally provided in the form 
of an orbital element set or state vector&mdash;we must begin at that point and 
'step' along in time until we get to the point we are interested in doing our 
calculations for. From a computational perspective, this approach can require 
considerable calculations. We would prefer to have a model which provides an 
analytical solution, that is, a solution wherein if we know the time of interest 
we can directly calculate the state of the satellite's orbit at that time 
without the need to 'step' along in time.</p>

<p>In our next column, we will examine the implications of the material 
presented above and look at how they affected the historical development of the 
orbital propagators in use today, particularly those used by NORAD (the North 
American Aerospace Defense Command). Armed with this background, we will delve 
into the relationship between orbital data and orbital models and the importance 
of using the right data with the right model. We'll look at how the data to be 
used with an orbital model is generated and begin considering examples to 
illustrate the magnitude of the errors which can result from improper 
combinations of models and data.</p>

<p>I hope I've given you enough of an idea of some of the adventures ahead to 
make you want to come back. I look forward to seeing you here next time!</p>

<p>In our last column, we covered the basics of modeling as they apply to 
predicting the position of a satellite in earth orbit. As with any model, the 
complexity of the orbital model we choose depends upon several factors, chief 
among these being the accuracy of the desired predictions. At the same time, 
since we will be calculating predictions from this orbital model on a computer, 
we would also like to reduce the computational complexity of the model. 
Unfortunately, these two goals conflict, so we will seek a model which strikes 
an appropriate balance between the model's fidelity (accuracy) and the 
computational burden of producing a prediction.</p>

<p>In order to obtain the appropriate level of model fidelity, it will be 
necessary to determine the types and relative magnitudes of the forces acting 
upon the satellite. For our orbital model, these include the gravity of the 
earth along with perturbations due to the nonuniform mass distribution of the 
earth, gravitational attraction of the sun, moon, and planets, and atmospheric 
drag. Which of these forces are most important will depend not only on their 
relative magnitude but upon whether their effects are <i>periodic</i> or 
<i>secular</i>.</p>

<p>A periodic effect, such as your car's antenna whipping back and forth as you 
drive down the road, has little effect on the position of the tip of the antenna 
over time, even though the forces involved may be rather large. If you only need 
to know the position of the antenna tip to within one meter, you will likely 
ignore this effect. However, a secular effect, one which consistently increases 
or decreases over time, may have a considerable effect even though the force 
involved may be small. An example of a secular effect would be that of a light 
wind blowing a sailboat across the water.</p>

<p>As far as computational complexity is concerned, we noted at the close of the 
last column that there were two primary computational methods of implementing an 
orbital model. One was to start with a satellite's position and velocity and to 
sum, or integrate, all of the forces acting on the satellite. This total force 
is assumed to act on the satellite over some small time span, at the end of 
which a new position and velocity is calculated and the process is repeated. 
When implemented on a computer, this approach is known as numerical integration. 
The advantage of this approach is that if sufficient detail is given to the 
forces acting upon the satellite and small enough time steps are used, highly-
accurate predictions can be obtained. The down side to numerical integration is 
that we must calculate the satellite's position and velocity for each time step 
between our known initial conditions and our desired prediction time.</p>

<p>Depending upon the size of the time step and the length of the time interval, 
the computational burden for even a single satellite can be large. Now, multiply 
this problem by the approximately 7,500 objects currently tracked by NORAD (the 
North American Aerospace Defense Command) and you'll begin to appreciate the 
need for another solution. We would prefer to have a model which provides an 
analytical solution, that is, a solution wherein if we know the time of interest 
we can directly calculate the state of the satellite's orbit at that time 
without the need to 'step' along in time. This is our second computational 
method of implementing an orbital model.</p>

<p>During the 1970s, NORAD came up with just such a solution: a fully-analytical 
orbital model. With this model, known as SGP (for Simplified General 
Perturbation), a user can calculate a satellite's position and velocity at a 
particular time directly, without the need for numerical integration. The result 
is a considerable reduction in computational burden to support tracking the 
growing population of earth-orbiting satellites.</p>

<p>Obviously, some tradeoffs had to be made in the process of developing SGP. As 
with any model, certain simplifications had to be made and these simplifications 
place restrictions upon how the model can be used. In particular, the mass of 
the satellite relative to the mass of the earth is assumed to be negligible. In 
addition, the satellite is assumed to be in a low-eccentricity, near-earth orbit 
and not in a rapidly-decaying orbit. These conditions were true for a large 
percentage of the satellite population at the time SGP was developed and allowed 
a model to be formulated accounting only for the primary perturbations on these 
satellites due to the earth's nonuniform mass distribution and atmospheric 
drag.</p>

<p>Subsequent refinements to SGP extended this theory to include a semi-analytic 
treatment of orbits with periods greater than 225 minutes. While this theory 
does depend to some extent upon numerical integration, the computational burden 
is still considerably reduced. The break at 225 minutes (about 6,000 km 
altitude) is the result of a somewhat natural gap which has resulted from 
historical choices of orbits for various satellite missions and a crossover in 
significant perturbing effects; above the gap the primary perturbing forces are 
no longer atmospheric drag and the earth's nonuniform density, but orbital 
resonances with the earth's nonuniform gravitational field, solar and lunar 
gravitational forces, and solar radiation pressure. This new model is referred 
to as SGP4 and is the model currently in use by NORAD and the United Stated 
Space Command.</p>

<p>You may be wondering, at this point, why I am focusing on the history of 
SGP4. Certainly, there are many other models, many of which are more accurate 
than SGP4. But SGP4 has one thing going for it that <i>none</i> of the others 
do: <i>data</i>. Not unlike the advent of automobiles running on unleaded 
gasoline, it didn't make any difference how slick a new car you had if you 
couldn't find any unleaded gas. Most other orbital models only provide data for 
a limited number of satellites (such as the space shuttle). NORAD, on the other 
hand, is responsible for tracking <i>all</i> satellites on a daily basis and it 
uses SGP4 to do that. This means that orbital data for this model is available 
for all earth-orbiting objects capable of being tracked by the US Space 
Surveillance Network.</p>

<p>But we're not talking about unleaded versus regular gasoline here. Aren't all 
orbital element sets alike? After all, they all measure things like inclination 
and semi-major axis (terms we'll define further in a future column) or I can 
convert to these terms. Why can't I take the NORAD elements and use them in my 
favorite tracking program (which doesn't use the SGP4 model)? Allow me to use a 
computer analogy here to explain.</p>

<p>Most of you are familiar with various algorithms for compressing data. 
Whether you know them by their formal names, such as run-length encoding, 
Huffman or LZW compression, or by the terms used by some of the popular 
archiving packages, such as squeezing, imploding, crushing, or the like, you 
wouldn't be too happy with the result if someone sent you data compressed by one 
method and you used another to uncompress it. Of course, your software would 
probably report an error, but that's not true of orbital software. But the 
result will be the same: errors.</p>

<p>The two-line orbital element sets made available by NORAD (and redistributed 
by NASA) are mean Keplerian orbital element sets. The mean values for each 
element are generated <i>using the SGP4 orbital model</i>. The effects of the 
major perturbing forces are incorporated into these mean values in a very 
specific way using SGP4 and SGP4 <i>must</i> be used to generate accurate 
predictions. Failure to do so will result in errors, the magnitude of which will 
depend heavily on the type of orbit being modeled. These errors are typically 
manifested as large time errors in satellite signal or visual acquisition or 
being unable to locate the satellite at all.</p>

<p>The implications of the last couple of paragraphs should be clear. Just as you
wouldn't expect to find a program compressed with LHARC to be distributed with a .ZIP
extension, the <i>only</i> data distributed in the two-line format should be
NORAD-generated SGP4-compatible data. Data from other sources should <i>never</i> be
reformatted into the two-line format just so it can be fed into a particular software
package unless you don't care about the accuracy of the results (just as you
wouldn't rename a file with an .LHA extension to .ZIP just so you could use PKUNZIP).</p>

<p>Many popular commercial, shareware, and public domain satellite tracking packages
implement SGP4 and you should check for this feature if you are concerned about accurate
predictions. We will review some of these packages in a future column. And, if you are
concerned about the source of your data, allow me to suggest two reliable sources. Daily
updates of NORAD-generated two-line orbital element sets are available via Internet
(anonymous ftp, gopher, or mosaic) on archive.afit.af.mil
in the directory pub/space or on the Celestial BBS at 205/409-9280 <i>[Neither
of these services is currently available. Data can now be found only on the 
<a href="http://celestrak.org">CelesTrak WWW site</A>.]</i>.
Both services are available free of charge to all users.</p>

<p>In our next column, we will explore how the NORAD two-line element sets are generated
and give some numerical examples to illustrate the magnitude of the errors which can
result from improper combinations of models and data. I look forward to seeing you here
next time!</p>

<p>On the morning of 1995 February 9, I awoke a bit earlier than usual. Not that 
I was any more anxious than usual to get to work that day. Instead, I realized 
that I had a rare opportunity to watch a celestial event of historical import. 
What made this event even more exciting was that I was able to predict just when 
it would be visible from my new home in Montgomery, Alabama.</p>

<p>For several days, I had been watching the television coverage of the first 
rendezvous of the US Space Shuttle with the Russian Mir Space Station. As 
amazing as it was to watch these two large spacecraft maneuver around each other 
on television, I was anxious to have the opportunity to watch this celestial 
ballet live. After all, this is where "the rubber meets the road" for orbital 
mechanics. With a fresh set of NORAD two-line orbital elements for both Mir and 
the Space Shuttle and my trusty TrakStar prediction software using the NORAD 
SGP4 orbital model, I began calculating when I might have my chance.</p>

<p>Of course, a number of conditions have to be met for you to be able to 
visually observe an low-earth-orbiting satellite. First, the satellite must pass 
over your location. That means that the satellite's orbit must have an 
inclination greater than or (approximately) equal to your latitude (north or 
south). For many Space Shuttle launches, the inclination is only 28.5 degrees 
(the latitude of the Kennedy Space Center where the Space Shuttle is launched 
from) and only a small percentage of the southern United States will even "see" 
the Space Shuttle pop above the horizon. On this mission, however, the Space 
Shuttle was launched into a 51.6-degree inclination in order to rendezvous with 
the Mir Space Station. That meant that our first condition would be met for a 
large percentage of the Earth's populated landmasses.</p>

<p>The next condition which must be met is for the satellite to pass over your 
location <i>at the right time of day</i>. This condition is very important. 
Basically, the observer must be in darkness and the satellite must be 
illuminated by sunlight to be visible. For the observer to be in darkness, the 
Sun must be six degrees or more below the horizon. For a satellite at the 
altitude of Mir or the Space Shuttle, it must be passing near the Earth's 
terminator (the line on the Earth's surface dividing day and night) within an 
hour or so after the onset of nightfall or before daybreak. If the satellite 
passes over at some other time of day, it simply will not be visible to the 
naked eye.</p>

<p>As luck would have it, the conditions were met for this mission, although 
they wouldn't come together for me until after the rendezvous was over. 
Nonetheless, both spacecraft, with their crews of astronauts and cosmonauts, 
would be chasing each other across the Alabama morning sky. Now, all that was 
needed was good weather.</p>

<p>My calculations had shown that STS 63 would pop up out of the Earth's shadow 
at 0554 CST at 14 degrees above the horizon, just north of west. Two minutes 
later, the Mir Space Station would appear at the same location. Two minutes 
might not seem like much of a separation, but at 7.5 km/sec, that's a distance 
of almost 1,000 km. Both spacecraft would rise to just over 45 degrees above the 
horizon before heading back to the horizon to the southeast. Once again, luck 
was on my side since I had a nice unobstructed view in this direction.</p>

<p>As I walked outside, it was a brisk -3 degrees Celsius (okay, brisk for 
Montgomery), but the sky was crystal clear. I started the car and began looking 
for STS 63. I didn't have to wait long, with STS 63 popping into view exactly 
when and where TrakStar had said it would. Suddenly, it didn't seem as cold any 
more. I watched as it arced up toward the apex of its trajectory and then looked 
back down to the horizon. Again, just as expected, there was the Mir space 
station at the same place I'd first seen the Space Shuttle. Wow!</p>

<p>I was actually seeing both the Space Shuttle and the Mir Space Station in the 
sky at the same time! And, they were right on schedule according to my program 
(that always makes me feel a lot better). I couldn't have asked for a better 
view, either. With both Venus and Jupiter in the morning sky, it was easy to use 
them as benchmarks to determine the brightness of the two spacecraft&mdash;each 
was about as bright as Jupiter and pretty tough to miss. It really was wonderful 
to experience the excitement of calculating a visual satellite pass and watching 
it unfold, as predicted. It sure brings those numbers to life.</p>

<p>Since this will not be the last time these two spacecraft will meet in space, 
you will have the opportunity to go out and watch these events for yourself. In 
fact, the Space Shuttle is scheduled to dock with Mir sometime later this year. 
So, what do you need to do to prepare to observe?</p>

<p>As was pointed out in my previous columns, the first two things you'll need 
will be current element sets and the appropriate orbital model. The most 
widely-available source of orbital data for Mir is the NORAD two-line element 
sets. These elements are available via Internet at archive.afit.af.mil in the 
directory pub/space <i>[no longer available]</i> 
and via dial-up modem on the Celestial BBS at (334) 409-9280 <i>[dial-up BBS no 
longer available]</i> in the Satellite directory of the Files section. These 
elements are updated every weekday (except holidays). The Mir elements can be 
found in the file MIR.TLE. These elements are also echoed to many other Internet 
sites, VANs (Value-Added Networks such as CompuServe and America Online), and 
BBSs around the world. For the docking of the Space Shuttle to the Mir Space 
Station later this year, your best bet to be prepared is to predict viewing 
conditions using the Mir orbital elements until the elements for the Space 
Shuttle become available (Mir has nowhere near the maneuvering capability of the 
Space Shuttle).</p>

<p>Why are timely orbital elements important? For Mir, they are important 
because the orbit is constantly changing due to the effects of changing 
atmospheric drag and maneuvers to maintain the space station's orbit. Mir also 
maneuvers to support rendezvous with the Soyuz and Progress spacecraft which 
supply it and, now, the Space Shuttle. We'll see just how important this is in a 
little bit.</p>

<p>For the orbital model, any package that implements the NORAD SGP4 model 
should suffice. I use TrakStar because it does one thing many other tracking 
programs do not: it calculates visible-only passes. That is, it can be set to 
output data only when the satellite is illuminated and the observer is in 
darkness. It doesn't output graphically, but the tabular ASCII output can be 
easily imported into any spreadsheet software or other plotting package of your 
choice to produce a trajectory. The key ingredient, however, is the use of the 
SGP4 orbital model.</p>

<p>Here's why. In an ideal orbit, the basic orbital elements are constants. That 
is, the orbital altitude, eccentricity, inclination, and orientation of the 
orbit in space are all fixed. In real life, however, perturbations on the orbit 
due to the nonuniform density of the Earth and atmospheric drag cause 
fluctuations in a satellite's orbit. Let's look some specifics for Mir on the 
day of my observation to illustrate these effects.</p>

<p>The Mir element set I used for my calculations was:</p>

<pre>
1 16609U 86017A   95039.25598067  .00011090  00000-0  14726-3 0  9200

<p>The key fields from this element set are:</p>

<br>
<p>Assuming the mean elements of this element set to be constants (which many 
non-SGP4 programs do), would yield a semi-major axis (half the distance between 
the satellite's closest and farthest approaches to the Earth) of 6,769 km. 
However, an examination of the semi-major axis over a time period of six hours 
shows it to be far from constant, varying by about 12 km over a single orbit 
(see Figure 1). And, while not immediately obvious from this plot, the altitude 
is slowly decaying with time. At this altitude, an error of 1 km in altitude 
corresponds to just over a 1 sec error <i>per revolution</i> in the orbital 
period&mdash;that's about 20 seconds per day. Larger errors in altitude will 
produce correspondingly larger errors in time for the position of the 
satellite.</p>

<p>Looking next at the right ascension of the ascending node, the direction in 
space where the orbit plane crosses the Earth's equator from south to north, we 
see that this node precesses at a rate of over 4 degrees per day (see Figure 2). 
At Mir's altitude, that can cause an error of about 500 km per day! Also, notice 
that while there is a small periodic effect, the secular (trending) effect is 
quite pronounced.</p>

<p class=center><b>Figure 2. Right Ascension of the Ascending Node (deg) vs. Time (hr)</b></p>

<p>Finally, to give some idea of the complexity of the fluctuations that can be 
seen in the orbital elements, let's look at how the argument of perigee for Mir 
changes over a six-hour period (Figure 3). The argument of perigee is the angle 
between the right ascension of the ascending node and the direction of the 
perigee, or closest approach to the Earth's center, measured along the orbit 
path. As this angle fluctuates, the point where the satellite is lowest also 
fluctuates, resulting in even more errors. In our example, several periodic 
effects appear to be present.</p>

<p class=center><img class=auto alt="Figure 3" src="fig-3.gif" width=574 height=428></p>

<p class=center><b>Figure 3. Argument of Perigee (deg) vs. Time (hr)</b></p>

<p>When we combine all the effects in the SGP4 model and compare it to a simple 
two-body propagator, we find an error of 150 km after only six hours and almost 
400 km by the end of the day! Given element sets which may be several days old, 
the errors can be on the order of thousands of kilometers! And using a model 
which incorporates the perturbations in a manner contradictory to SGP4 can make 
the errors even worse.</p>

<p>In our next column, we'll look at what criteria are used to determine when an 
element set needs updating and what mathematical methods are used. Once we're 
done with that, we'll start exploring some of the basics of taking the output of 
SGP4 to produce calculations like those in TrakStar. See you next time!</p>

<p>Up to now, we've talked about orbital models, sources of data, and some of 
the complexities involved with predicting the motion of artificial earth 
satellites. The goal here is, of course, to get a handle on the amount of error 
that can be expected in a particular calculation. After all, the art of 
celestial mechanics has been refined for centuries and, with the advent of 
computers, we'd like to think we can depend upon those calculations to be 
accurate. That way, when we're watching or listening for a satellite to pass 
overhead, we won't be wondering if we missed the pass because of a bad 
calculation.</p>

<p>Besides knowing what data to use with which models, the next most important 
part of the process to understand is how orbital element sets are generated. An 
understanding of this process will help to answer two questions: How often are 
the orbital element sets updated and (most importantly) how often do I have to 
update my data? As with everything else in this field, answering these questions 
will require a bit of work.</p>

<p>To begin with, let's assume that we already have a basic orbit for our 
satellite of interest. After all, the overwhelming majority of satellites 
tracked every day have been on orbit for some time and we are really interested 
in how we update the orbital element sets for these objects. We will save a 
description of the process of how to determine an initial element set for a 
satellite orbit for a future column.</p>

<p>To update any existing orbital element set, observations must first be 
collected. NORAD, which has responsibility for tracking all man-made objects in 
earth orbit, uses the Space Surveillance Network (SSN) to collect these 
observations. This network is comprised of radar sensors for near-earth tracking 
(below approximately 6,000 kilometers altitude) and optical (actually, 
electro-optical) sensors for deep-space objects (above 6,000 kilometers 
altitude). These sensors are geographically distributed around the world to 
provide global coverage.</p>

<p>Typical observations from a radar site might include azimuth, elevation, 
range, and range rate while optical sensors provide angles only (azimuth and 
elevation or right ascension and declination). Each observation is time tagged 
as it is collected. If you are not familiar with some of these measurement 
types, don't be concerned&mdash;the specific measurement types won't be 
important to this development and we'll cover these terms in detail when we talk 
about coordinate systems in our next column.</p>

<p>Of course, since there are thousands of objects orbiting the earth, knowing 
which observations are associated with which object is no trivial task. NORAD 
must first process the observations to correlate them with the appropriate 
object or determine that the observations represent the track of a previously 
untracked (or lost) object. Once a set of observations has been associated with 
a particular satellite track, however, the mathematical process of updating the 
element set can begin. The process used is known as the method of differential 
corrections. Here's how it works.</p>

<p>As the differential corrections process begins, there are several things we 
"know." The first is the initial two-line element set, the second is our 
time-tagged set of observations, and the third is the orbital model we want to use 
(SGP4, in this case). In order to determine whether our current two-line element 
set must be adjusted, we must be able to compare it directly to the set of 
observations we've collected.</p>

<p>While we don't know how to convert observations directly into an element set 
(after all, that's the goal of this process), we do know how to convert an 
element set into a set of predicted observations. To generate these predicted 
observations, we use the current two-line element set with the SGP4 orbital 
model to generate the satellite's expected position and velocity and then 
transform this information into expected observations for the particular viewing 
geometry of the sensor. Now, we can calculate the difference of the actual and 
expected observations. As might be expected, our goal is to minimize this 
difference (in reality, the sum of the squares of the differences).</p>

<p>So far, this process sounds simple enough. But how do we know which elements 
to change and by how much to make the overall difference smaller? Well, as it 
turns out, we can use some basic calculus to answer this question. Let's say we 
have one element, <i>x</i> (our independent variable), and one observation, 
<i>y</i> (our dependent variable). Also, let the transformation from element to 
observation be given by the transformation function</p>

<p class=center><i>y</i> = <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>).</p>

<p>Now, let the actual observation be <i>y<sub>a</sub></i> and the predicted 
observation be <i>y<sub>p</sub></i> = <i>f</i>(<i>x<sub>p</sub></i>). From 
calculus, we know that we can approximate the derivative of our transformation 
at <i>x<sub>p</sub></i> as</p>

<p class=center><img class=auto alt="Equation" src="eq-2.gif" width=184 height=49">.</p>

<p>Solving for our "actual" value of the element yields</p>

<p class=center><img class=auto alt="Equation" src="eq-3.gif" width=248 height=44">.</p>

<p>This is a basic Newton iteration for finding a root of a function. For it to 
work well, our initial value of the element must be "close" to the actual value. 
Each time we calculate a new "actual" value, we repeat the process by replacing 
our predicted value with the "actual" value until the difference in the 
predicted and actual elements between successive calculations is "small."</p>

<p>We are still missing one part, however, in making this process work. The part 
we're missing is how to calculate the derivative of the observation with respect 
to the element (in other words, the rate of change in the observation with 
respect to a change in the element). If our transformation function 
<i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) were simple enough, we could calculate this value 
analytically (well, at least some of us could). However, for our real problem, 
our transformation function takes the values from a two-line element set, runs 
them through the SGP4 orbital model, and then transforms them for the sensor 
viewing geometry and coordinate system. Calculating this derivative analytically 
would be extremely difficult, if not impossible. Instead, we will numerically 
estimate the derivative by using the same approximation as we did above. That 
is, we take our initial value of element and some small difference to 
produce</p>

<p class=center><img class=auto alt="Equation" src="eq-4.gif" width=302 height=44">.</p>

<p>Once we have an estimate of the derivative at the point of interest, the 
process of updating the element is relatively easy. It is important to note here 
the dependence on the orbital model chosen in the transformation function. For 
the NORAD two-line orbital element sets, the orbital model is SGP4. Using 
another model would generate different elements because that model would produce 
a different "best track" through the observations. Therefore, to get the best 
fit for the NORAD two-line element sets, the SGP4 orbital model <i>must</i> be 
used.</p>

<p>In reality, the process of updating the NORAD two-line element set has many 
orbital elements and observations, so the full differential corrections process 
must use a multidimensional Newton search. But the basic approach is still the 
same. Once the process has converged, that is, the difference between the 
observed position and the calculated position is within some small tolerance, we 
have a new element set.</p>

<p>Does this mean that a new element set is issued by NORAD? The answer to this 
question is no. A new element set is issued only when the position predicted by 
the current element set differs from that predicted by the new element set by 
more than a certain amount. In the case of the NORAD two-line element sets, that 
amount is five kilometers (with a 90 percent confidence interval).</p>

<p>So how often are the element sets updated? Well, that depends upon the 
satellite and its orbit. For near-earth satellites, atmospheric drag can change 
an orbit in ways that aren't modeled in SGP4, requiring more frequent updates. 
Also, satellites which maneuver frequently, such as Mir or the US Space Shuttle, 
will also require more frequent updates since, again, SGP4 is unable to model 
these changes. You can get a rough idea of how often you need to update your 
element sets by looking at how long it takes NORAD to issue consecutive element 
sets for the objects you are interested in. If they issue one element set a 
week, that means that it takes roughly a week before the orbit has changed 
enough to require an update. Of course, if you don't need this level of accuracy 
for your application, then you won't need every update. Remember, five 
kilometers is less than a second's error at orbital velocity.</p>

<p>Now that we have seen how and when orbital element sets are updated, let's 
explore why NORAD issues separate element sets for objects which are docked 
together and why those element sets are not identical. A good example of this 
practice is with the Mir space station. The Mir complex is actually made up of 
many objects: the Mir core, Kristall, Kvant-1, Kvant-2, and an assortment of 
Soyuz and/or Progress modules. Each of these objects was launched individually 
and tracked by NORAD before docking with the space station. Some of these 
objects will subsequently undock. As such, NORAD maintains separate tracks of 
each object.</p>

<p>Of course, when these objects are physically locked together, the 
observations collected for one object could be used for updating the elements 
for all objects. But that's not necessarily how it works. Since NORAD has to 
track over 7,000 objects every day, the process is automated. Now, since all 
observations have error and each object started with its own independent element 
set, the element sets generated will remain in tolerance for differing periods 
of time. How long will depend on the site used to collect the observations, the 
viewing geometry, changes in atmospheric density or spacecraft attitude, 
maneuvers, and so on. As such, updates to separate components of a docked 
structure will be updated at different times.</p>

<p>Okay, so even if NORAD tracks each object separately and maintains separate 
element sets, why are the element sets different? To understand the answer to 
this question, you need only look to our last column. Remember, only ideal 
orbits describe true ellipses and have constant orbital elements. Real orbits 
experience both periodic and secular (trending) effects in their elements. 
Because of this, orbital element sets with different epochs will have different 
values (and different associated errors) for the remaining orbital elements.</p>

<p>Now, you might think that a single element set would result in no error. 
However, the error is still there&mdash;a single element set just seems more 
consistent. Actually, multiple element sets provide the advantage of 
redundancy&mdash;protecting you from the occasional bad element set.</p>

<p>Well, we covered a lot of territory in this column. If you feel a bit lost, 
don't feel bad. Remember, when we started, I promised to address issues for the 
novice to the professional. If you have questions, you are more than welcome to 
send them to me at 
<a href="mailto:TS.Kelso@celestrak.org">TS.Kelso@celestrak.org</a>.
I'll do my best to help fill in any gaps.</p>

<p>For our next column, we'll finally start into the discussion of the various 
coordinate systems used in satellite tracking. Our goal will be to develop an 
understanding of the various terms used and the importance of each coordinate 
system. The end result will be to develop methods to transform orbital elements 
into things like look angles (azimuth and elevation or right ascension and 
declination) for visual observations and tracking or latitude, longitude, and 
altitude for plotting on a map or working with satellite imagery. Until then, 
keep looking up!</p>

<p>By this point, I hope to have helped you develop an understanding of two key 
aspects of practical orbital mechanics. The first has to do with why we use the 
orbital models we do for predicting the position of earth-orbiting artificial 
satellites. As with any computer model, orbital models must trade off accuracy 
for computational speed. Which model you decide to use will depend upon which of 
these factors is most important to you.</p>

<p>Of course, from a practical perspective, the choice of orbital model is also 
strongly influenced by the availability of data (element sets). Knowing that 
orbital element sets are generated by fitting observations to a trajectory based 
upon a particular orbital model is the second of our key aspects. Accuracy of 
our predictions will depend upon using that same orbital model.</p>

<p>Up to now, however, all we've really talked about are orbital element sets. 
But how do we get from the data in these orbital element sets to something we 
can use, such as knowing where to look (or point an antenna) when a satellite 
passes over? To answer this question requires an understanding of the various 
coordinate systems involved and how to transform coordinates (typically position 
and velocity) from one system to another. The correct application of these 
coordinate transformations is every bit as important to our overall accuracy as 
the selection of the orbital model itself.</p>

<p>Where do we start? Let's start with the orbital element sets themselves and 
discuss some terminology. The two most common forms of orbital element sets are 
<i>state vectors</i> and <i>Keplerian orbital elements</i> (e.g., the NORAD 
two-line element sets). A <i>state vector</i> is a collection of values (states) 
that if known, together with the <i>state transformation rules</i> (how the 
state vector changes over time), the state vector for any past or future time 
can be computed. For a satellite in Earth orbit, if we ignore atmospheric drag 
and maneuvering, the state vector would be comprised of the satellite's position 
and velocity. Knowing the position alone would not be sufficient, since a 
satellite with zero velocity would fall to Earth while one with orbital velocity 
would not, even if the satellites start at the same physical location.</p>

<p>We cannot, however, talk about position and velocity without discussing the 
coordinate system that these values are measured relative to. For most state 
vectors, this is the <i>Earth-Centered Inertial</i> (ECI) coordinate system. The 
first part of this designation should seem fairly obvious. That is, since we're 
studying objects that revolve around the center of the Earth, it seems natural 
to have the center (origin) of our coordinate system at the center of the Earth. 
Inertial, in this context, simply means that the coordinate system is not 
accelerating (rotating). In other words, it is 'fixed' in space relative to the 
stars. We shall see that this is an ideal definition of the ECI coordinate 
system, but we won't worry about the slight rotations involved until later.</p>

<p>The ECI coordinate system (see Figure 1) is typically defined as a 
<i>Cartesian</i> coordinate system, where the coordinates (position) are defined 
as the distance from the origin along the three orthogonal (mutually 
perpendicular) axes. The <i>z</i> axis runs along the Earth's rotational axis 
pointing North, the <i>x</i> axis points in the direction of the <i>vernal 
equinox</i> (more on this in a moment), and the <i>y</i> axis completes the 
right-handed orthogonal system. As seen in Figure 1, the vernal equinox is an 
imaginary point in space which lies along the line representing the intersection 
of the Earth's equatorial plane and the plane of the Earth's orbit around the 
Sun or the <i>ecliptic</i>. Another way of thinking of the <i>x</i> axis is that 
it is the line segment pointing from the center of the Earth towards the center 
of the Sun at the beginning of Spring, when the Sun crosses the Earth's equator 
moving North. The <i>x</i> axis, therefore, lies in both the equatorial plane 
and the ecliptic. These three axes defining the Earth-Centered Inertial 
coordinate system are 'fixed' in space and do not rotate with the Earth.</p>

<p class=center><img class=auto alt="Figure 1" src="fig-1a.gif" width=748 height=680></p>

<p class=center><b>Figure 1. Earth-Centered Inertial (ECI) Coordinate System</b></p>

<p>Now, while state vectors are normally used with numerical integration models 
for highly accurate calculations, Keplerian orbital elements are used for the 
vast majority of orbital predictions. But, the ECI coordinate system is still 
often used as the common coordinate system when performing coordinate 
transformations. For example, before a calculation can be made of the distance 
between a satellite and an observer on the ground, both the satellite and the 
observer's position must be defined in a common coordinate system. Since the 
satellite's position is typically represented by a Keplerian orbital element set 
and the observer's position is given in latitude, longitude, and altitude above 
the Earth's surface, we cannot perform the calculation directly without first 
converting to a common coordinate frame.</p>

<p>As it turns out, the NORAD SGP4 orbital model takes the standard two-line 
orbital element set and the time and produces an ECI position and velocity for 
the satellite. In particular, it puts it in an ECI frame relative to the "true 
equator and mean equinox of the epoch" of the element set. This specific 
distinction is necessary because the direction of the Earth's true rotation axis 
(the North Pole) wanders slowly over time, as does the true direction of the 
vernal equinox. Since observations of satellites are made by stations fixed to 
the Earth's surface, the elements generated will be referenced relative to the 
true equator. However, since the direction of vernal equinox is not tied to the 
Earth's surface, but rather to the Earth's orientation in space, an 
approximation must be made of its true direction. The approximation made in this 
case is to account for the precession of the vernal equinox but to ignore the 
<i>nutation</i> (nodding) of the Earth's <i>obliquity</i> (the angle between the 
equatorial plane and the ecliptic). We'll address how to use this level of 
detail in a future column.</p>

<p>So, we now know that whether we're using state vectors or Keplerian orbital 
element sets, our calculations will likely yield ECI position and velocity. 
Let's begin working now to answer two common questions in satellite tracking. 
The first question is: Where do I look or point my antenna to acquire a 
particular satellite? The second question is: What is the latitude, longitude, 
and altitude of that satellite? These questions come up frequently, whether the 
goal is to watch the US Space Shuttle and Russian Mir Space Station pass 
overhead, to acquire an amateur radio satellite, or to determine the longitude 
of a geostationary TVRO satellite. But, to be able to answer these questions, we 
will need to determine either the position of an observer on the Earth relative 
to the ECI coordinate frame or the position of a satellite relative to the 
Earth. In either case, we will need to know the rotation angle between the 
Greenwich Meridian (zero degrees longitude) and the vernal equinox and, hence, 
the orientation of the Earth relative to the ECI coordinate frame.</p>

<p>Let's start by calculating the position of an observer in the ECI coordinate 
frame. For our initial discussions, we'll assume a spherical Earth. This 
assumption is not a particularly good one, as we'll see in our next column, but 
will make the initial development easier to follow. The calculation of the 
<i>z</i> coordinate is straightforward, as can be seen in Figure 2. This figure 
shows a side cutaway of the Earth with North up. For an observer at latitude 
&phi;, the <i>z</i> coordinate is shown in Figure 2, where <i>R<sub>e</sub></i> 
is the Earth's equatorial radius. To calculate the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> 
coordinates, we will also need the value of <i>R</i> from Figure 2. If we wanted 
to calculate <i>z</i> and <i>R</i> for distances above mean sea level, we would 
simply replace <i>R<sub>e</sub></i> with <i>R<sub>e</sub></i> + <i>h</i>, where 
<i>h</i> is the distance above mean sea level.</p>

<p class=center><img class=auto alt="Figure 2" src="fig-2.gif" width=482 height=371"></p>

<p class=center><b>Figure 2. Latitude to ECI Conversion</b></p>

<p>Computing the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> coordinates requires a bit more work. 
Since the Earth rotates in the <i>x-y</i> plane (i.e., about the <i>z</i> axis), 
the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> coordinates of a point on the Earth's surface will 
vary with time, unlike the <i>z</i> coordinate. However, if we know the angle 
between the observer's longitude and the <i>x</i> axis (the vernal equinox), we 
can specify the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> coordinates as a function of time. In 
fact, if we designate the angle between the <i>x</i> axis and the observer's 
longitude as &theta;(&tau;), where &tau; is the time of interest, 
<i>x</i>(&tau;) and <i>y</i>(&tau;) are given in Figure 3. This figure shows a 
slice through the Earth, parallel to the equatorial plane and through the 
observer's location.</p>

<p class=center><img class=auto alt="Figure 3" src="fig-3.gif" width=640 height=480></p>

<p class=center><b>Figure 3. Longitude to ECI Conversion</b></p>

<p>Upon first inspection, these equations would seem straightforward enough. But 
just what is &theta;(&tau;) and how is it calculated? The function 
&theta;(&tau;) is what astronomers refer to as the <i>local sidereal time</i>. 
<i>Sidereal time</i> is simply time measured relative to the stars. In our 
day-to-day lives, we are used to measuring time relative to the position of the Sun 
because of its obvious position in the heavens. This time scale is referred to 
as<i> mean solar time</i>. As with any time system, time is defined as the angle 
between the observer and some reference direction. With mean solar time, the 
reference direction is the direction of the mean sun; with sidereal time, the 
direction is the vernal equinox&mdash;just the direction we need for our 
calculation. So what causes the difference between these two time scales?</p>

<p>As seen in Figure 4, the position of the Sun moves with respect to the stars 
because of the Earth's orbit around it. Let's say we noted the position of the 
Sun relative to the stars when it crosses our meridian (longitude) on one day. 
By definition, that passage is called local noon. However, when that same 
position relative to the stars crosses our meridian on the following day, the 
Sun will not yet have reached our meridian. That is to say, the position will 
cross our meridian before local noon. The interval of time between two 
successive meridian crossings of a fixed position in inertial space is referred 
to as one <i>sidereal day</i>. Sidereal midnight occurs when the vernal equinox 
crosses the meridian. The interval of time between two successive meridian 
crossings of the mean sun is referred to as one mean solar day. As seen in 
Figure 4, the Earth must rotate a bit more for a mean solar day than for a 
sidereal day. In fact, a sidereal day is only 
23<sup>h</sup>56<sup>m</sup>04<sup>s</sup>.09054 of mean solar time. This 
difference, while small, is extremely important.</p>

<p class=center><img class=auto alt="Figure 4" src="fig-4.gif" width=640 height=480></p>

<p class=center><b>Figure 4. Sidereal versus Solar Time</b></p>

<p>Now, since all of our common time measurements are based on UTC (Coordinated 
Universal Time) which is mean solar time, how do we calculate our local sidereal 
time? Well, as shown in Figure 3, the local sidereal time can be calculated by 
adding the observer's <i>east</i> longitude, &lambda;<sub>E</sub>, to the 
Greenwich sidereal time (GST), &theta;<sub>g</sub>(&tau;). Oftentimes, GST (or 
more specifically, Greenwich Mean Sidereal Time or GMST), can be found in 
references such as the US Naval Observatory's <i>Astronomical Almanac</i>. If 
GMST is known for 0<sup>h</sup> UTC, &theta;<sub>g</sub>(0<sup>h</sup>), on a 
particular date, then &theta;<sub>g</sub>(&Delta;&tau;) = 
&theta;<sub>g</sub>(0<sup>h</sup>) + &omega;<sub>e</sub>&middot;&Delta;&tau;, 
where &Delta;&tau; is the UTC time of interest and &omega;<sub>e</sub> = 
7.29211510 &times; 10<sup>-5</sup> radians/second is the 
Earth's rotation rate. Unfortunately, this approach requires a table of 
reference times to do the calculations. Another approach is to calculate 
&theta;<sub>g</sub>(0<sup>h</sup>) using the equation from Page 50 of the 
<A TARGET="_BLANK" HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/iSBN=0935702687/8457-7991521-393883"><i>Explanatory 
Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac</i></a>:</p>

<p class=center>&theta;<sub>g</sub>(0<sup>h</sup>) = 24110<sup>s</sup>.54841 + 
8640184<sup>s</sup>.812866 <i>T<sub>u</sub></i> + 0<sup>s</sup>.093104 
<i>T<sub>u</sub></i><sup>2</sup> - 6.2 &times; 10<sup>-
6</sup> <i>T<sub>u</sub></i><sup>3</sup></p>

<p>where <i>T<sub>u</sub></i> = <i>d<sub>u</sub></i>/36525 and 
<i>d<sub>u</sub></i> is the number of days of Universal Time elapsed since JD 
2451545.0 (2000 January 1, 12h UT1).</p>

<p>While we've covered a lot of ground in this column, we obviously still have a 
bit more to go before we can answer the questions raised above. For our computer 
implementation, we will first need to develop a procedure for calculating the 
Julian Date in our last equation. Then, we will need to refine our conversion 
from latitude, longitude, and altitude to ECI coordinates to incorporate an 
oblate (flattened) Earth. When we make this refinement, we will also see the 
magnitude of error which can occur if this factor is ignored. At this point, we 
will have finished our first coordinate transformation and will be able to 
calculate the vector from the Earth observer to the satellite. We will then 
begin the process of developing our second coordinate transformation, that from 
ECI to the topocentric-horizon or azimuth-elevation coordinate system. It is 
this system which will allow us to measure the position of a satellite relative 
to the Earth's surface.</p>

<p>We will also begin to include snippets of computer code to illustrate the 
theory we're developing here. If you'd like to look ahead, these routines can be 
found in the file <a href="/software/satellite/sgp4-plb26a.zip">sgp4-plb26a.zip</a>

<p>In our last column, we were working our way through the process of 
calculating the position and velocity of an observer on the Earth's surface in 
the Earth-Centered Inertial (ECI) reference frame. The goal, of course, was to 
be able to determine the position of the observer relative to an orbiting 
satellite to aid the process of visually acquiring or otherwise tracking the 
satellite from the ground.</p>

<p>At the end of the last column, we had seen that it would be impossible to 
determine an observer's position in the ECI reference frame without knowing that 
observer's local sidereal time, that is, the angle between the observer's 
meridian (longitude) and the vernal equinox. But because this time is measured 
relative to the stars and not the Sun, the equations to do the calculations are 
a bit complicated. Let's start of this column with a brief review of the 
equation for the local sidereal time and then explore, bit by bit, how to 
develop a computer routine to calculate this value for us. We will then continue 
the process by calculating the remaining information needed to determine an 
observer's position in the ECI reference frame.</p>

<p>As we saw last time, the local sidereal time, &theta;(&tau;), can be 
calculated by adding the observer's <i>east</i> longitude, &lambda;<sub>E</sub>, 
to the Greenwich sidereal time (GST), &theta;<sub>g</sub>(&tau;). Using an 
equation from Page 50 of the 
<a target="_BLANK" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0935702687/8457-7991521-393883"><i>Explanatory
Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac</i></a>, we can first determine &theta;<sub>g</sub>(0<sup>h</sup>),
the Greenwich sidereal time at 0<sup>h</sup> (midnight) UTC, from which</p>

<p class=center>&theta;<sub>g</sub>(&tau;) =
&theta;<sub>g</sub>(0<sup>h</sup>) + &omega;<sub>e</sub>&middot;&Delta;&tau;</p>

<p>where &Delta;&tau; is the UTC time of interest and &omega;<sub>e</sub>
= 7.29211510 &times; 10<sup>-5</sup> radians/second is the
Earth's rotation rate. Recalling that &theta;<sub>g</sub>(0<sup>h</sup>)
is given as</p>

<p class=center>&theta;<sub>g</sub>(0<sup>h</sup>) = 24110<sup>s</sup>.54841
+ 8640184<sup>s</sup>.812866 <var>T<sub>u</sub></var> + 0<sup>s</sup>.093104 <var>T<sub>u</sub></var><sup>2</sup>
- 6.2 &times; 10<sup>-6</sup> <var>T<sub>u</sub></var><sup>3</sup></p>

<p>where <var>T<sub>u</sub></var> = <var>d<sub>u</sub></var>/36525 and 
<var>d<sub>u</sub></var> is the number of days of Universal Time elapsed since JD 
2451545.0 (2000 January 1, 12<sup>h</sup> UT1), we can now set about determing 
what we know and what we need to calculate.</p>

<p>Let's develop a top-down algorithm to see what we need to do. Our goal in 
this portion of the algorithm is to determine the value of &theta;<sub>g</sub> 
at a particular time, &tau;. To do this, we need values of 
&theta;<sub>g</sub>(0<sup>h</sup>), &omega;<sub>e</sub>, and &Delta;&tau;. The 
value of &omega;<sub>e</sub> is fixed and &Delta;&tau; is the fraction of the 
day since 0<sup>h</sup> UTC or &Delta;&tau; = <i>fraction</i>(&tau;) in days. 
Therefore, we still need to know <var>T<sub>u</sub></var>, which depends upon 
<var>d<sub>u</sub></var>. But <var>d<sub>u</sub></var> depends upon knowing the number 
of days of Universal Time elapsed since JD 2451545.0. So, if we know the Julian 
Date (JD) of &tau;, we have everything we need. Our top-down algorithm then 
looks something like this: 

<ul>
  <p>Calculate: &theta;<sub>g</sub> which depends on 
  (&theta;<sub>g</sub>(0<sup>h</sup>), &omega;<sub>e</sub>, &Delta;&tau;); 
  &omega;<sub>e</sub> constant; &Delta;&tau; = <i>fraction</i>(&tau;)</p>
  <p>Calculate: &theta;<sub>g</sub>(0<sup>h</sup>) which depends on (<var>T<sub>u</sub></var>);
  <var>T<sub>u</sub></var> = <var>d<sub>u</sub></var>/36525</p>
  <p>Calculate: <var>d<sub>u</sub></var> which depends on (JD(&tau;))</p>
  <p>Calculate: JD(&tau;)</p>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, our most basic calculation is the determination of the Julian Date. The
Julian Date can be calculated from the equation in Section 12.95 (Page 606) 
<i>[actually, this should be Section 12.92 (Page 604)]</i> of the 
<a target="_BLANK" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0935702687/8457-7991521-393883"><i>Explanatory
Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac</i></a>, or using the approach on Page 61 of 
<a target="_BLANK" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0943396352/8457-7991521-393883"><i>Astronomical
Algorithms</i></a> by Jean Meeus. This latter text is an excellent reference source for
many relevant calculations in orbital mechanics and is highly recommended.</p>

<p>Using Meeus' approach, the Pascal code for calculating the Julian Date of January
0.0 of any year would be: 

<ul>
<pre>
Function Julian_Date_of_Year(year : double) : double;
{ Calculate Julian Date of 0.0 Jan year }
  var
    A,B : longint;
  begin
  year := year - 1;
  A := Trunc(year/100);
  B := 2 - A + Trunc(A/4);
  Julian_Date_of_Year := Trunc(365.25 * year)
                       + Trunc(30.6001 * 14)
                       + 1720994.5 + B;
  end; {Function Julian_Date_of_Year}
</pre>
</ul>

<p>To calculate the Julian Date of any calendar date, we simply combine the 
Julian Date of that year with the day of the year, where the day of the year can 
be calculated as: 

<ul>
<pre>
Function DOY(yr,mo,dy : word) : word;
  const
    days : array [1..12] of word = (31,28,31,30,31,30,31,31,30,31,30,31);
  var
    i,day : word;
  begin
  day := 0;
  for i := 1 to mo-1 do
    day := day + days[i];
  day := day + dy;
  if ((yr mod 4) = 0) and
     (((yr mod 100) &lt;&gt; 0) or ((yr mod 400) = 0)) and
     (mo &gt; 2) then
    day := day + 1;
  DOY := day;
  end; {Function DOY}
</pre>
</ul>

<p>As an example, the Julian Date of 0<sup>h</sup> UTC on 1995 October 01 would be written
as: 

<ul>
<pre>
JD := Julian_Date_of_Year(1995) + DOY(1995,10,1);
</pre>
</ul>

<p>with a result of 2449991.5 = 2449717.5 + 274. Therefore, <var>d<sub>u</sub></var> 
equals -1553.5 days and <var>T<sub>u</sub></var> equals -1553.5/36525. From this 
value of <var>T<sub>u</sub></var>, &theta;<sub>g</sub>(0<sup>h</sup>) can now be 
calculated to be -343378.2154 seconds. Since there are 86,400 seconds in a day, 
this is the same time (angle) as 2221.7846 seconds, so the equivalent GMST is 
0<sup>h</sup> 37<sup>m</sup> 01<sup>s</sup>.7846 or an angle of 9.257 
degrees.</p>

<p>Now, if the time of interest on 1995 October 01 was 9<sup>h</sup> UTC, we 
would have to add &omega;<sub>e</sub>&middot;&Delta;&tau; to the value of 
&theta;<sub>g</sub>(0<sup>h</sup>), where &Delta;&tau; = 32,400 seconds (9 
hours). Being careful to use the proper units, our new GMST is 9<sup>h</sup> 
38<sup>m</sup> 30<sup>s</sup>.4928 or 144.627 degrees.</p>

<p>We can consolidate our calculation of the Greenwich Mean Sidereal Time into 
the following simple Pascal function where the input is the Julian Date of the 
time of interest (in our example of 9<sup>h</sup> UTC on 1995 October 01, JD is 
2449991.875) and the output is the GMST in radians. For our test case, this 
should be 2.524218 radians. 

<ul>
<pre>
Function ThetaG_JD(jd : double) : double;
{ Reference:  The 1992 Astronomical Almanac, page B6. }
  var
    UT,TU,GMST : double;
  begin
  UT   := Frac(jd + 0.5);
  jd   := jd - UT;
  TU   := (jd - 2451545.0)/36525;
  GMST := 24110.54841 + TU * (8640184.812866 + TU * (0.093104 - TU * 6.2E-6));
  GMST := Modulus(GMST + 86400.0*1.00273790934*UT,86400.0);
  ThetaG_JD := twopi * GMST/86400.0;
  end; {Function ThetaG_JD}
</pre>
</ul>

<p>Now, we can complete our calculation of the ECI position of our observer. 
We'll start by assuming a spherical Earth and then go back and rework our 
solution, in our next column, using an oblate Earth. If our observer is located 
at 40&deg; North latitude and 75&deg; West longitude (near Philadelphia), we can 
easily calculate the <var>z</var> coordinate according to</p>

<p class=center><var>z = R<sub>e</sub></var> sin &phi;</p>

<p>where <var>R<sub>e</sub></var> = 6378.135 km and &phi; = 40&deg;. To
calculate <var>x</var> and <var>y</var>, we use</p>

<p class=center><var>x = R</var> cos &theta;</p>

<p class=center><var>y = R</var> sin &theta;</p>

<p>where</p>

<p class=center>&theta; = &theta;<sub>g</sub> + &lambda;<sub>E</sub></p>

<p class=center><var>R = R<sub>e</sub></var> cos &phi;.</p>

<p>Using our example, &lambda;<sub>E</sub> = -75&deg; and &theta;<sub>g</sub> = 
144&deg;.627, so &theta; = 69&deg;.627 (remember, this is the local sidereal 
time&mdash;the angle between the observer's meridian and the vernal equinox) and 
<var>R</var> = 4885.935 km. Therefore, the ECI position of our observer at the time 
of interest is:</p>

<p class=center><var>x</var> = 1700.938 km, <var>y</var> = 4580.302 km, <var>z</var> = 4099.786 km.</p>

<p>After all that work calculating the local sidereal time, the rest of the 
calculation was relatively easy! We can encapsulate this calculation using the 
following simple Pascal procedure: 

<ul>
<pre>
Procedure Calculate_User_Pos(lat,lon,alt,time : double;
                                    var x,y,z : double);
{ Reference:  The 1992 Astronomical Almanac, page K11. }
  const
    re = 6378.135;
  var
    theta : double;
  begin
  theta := Modulus(ThetaG_JD(time) + lon,twopi);
  r := (re + alt)*Cos(lat);
  x := r*Cos(theta);
  y := r*Sin(theta);
  z := (re + alt)*Sin(lat);
  end; {Procedure Calculate_User_Pos}
</pre>
</ul>

<p>In the inputs for this routine, <coding>lat</coding> and <coding>lon</coding> are in 
radians, <coding>alt</coding> is in kilometers, and <coding>time</coding> is the Julian 
Date of interest. The outputs (<coding>x</coding>, <coding>y</coding>, and 
<coding>z</coding>) are in kilometers.</p>

<p>So, how do we now calculate the look angle to a satellite? If the satellite's 
position in the ECI coordinate system is defined as [<var>x<sub>s</sub></var>, 
<var>y<sub>s</sub></var>, <var>z<sub>s</sub></var>] and the observer is 
[<var>x<sub>o</sub></var>, <var>y<sub>o</sub></var>, <var>z<sub>o</sub></var>], 
then the range vector is simply</p>

<p class=center>[<var>r<sub>x</sub></var>, <var>r<sub>y</sub></var>, 
<var>r<sub>z</sub></var>] = [<var>x<sub>s</sub> - x<sub>o</sub></var>, <var>y<sub>s</sub> 
- y<sub>o</sub></var>, <var>z<sub>s</sub> - z<sub>o</sub></var>].</p>

<p>This vector, however, is in the ECI system and to generate look angles, we 
need it to be in the topocentric-horizon system shown in Figure 1. That system 
has its <var>z</var> axis pointing toward the zenith, the <var>x</var> axis pointing 
South, and the <var>y</var> axis pointing East.</p>

<p class=center><img class=auto alt="Figure 1" src="fig-1.gif" width=531 height=381"></p>

<p class=center><b>Figure 1. Topocentric-Horizon Coordinate System</b></p>

<p>To transform to the topocentric-horizon system, we must first rotate through 
an angle &theta; (the local sidereal time) about the <var>z</var> axis (Earth 
rotation axis) and then through an angle &phi; (the observer's latitude) about 
the <var>y</var> axis. The coordinates (<var>r<sub>S</sub></var>, <var>r<sub>E</sub></var>, 
<var>r<sub>Z</sub></var>) become:</p>

<p class=center><var>r<sub>S</sub></var> = sin &phi; cos &theta; 
<var>r<sub>x</sub></var> + sin &phi; sin &theta; <var>r<sub>y</sub></var> - cos &phi; 
<var>r<sub>z</sub></var></p>

<p class=center><var>r<sub>E</sub></var> = -sin &theta; <var>r<sub>x</sub></var>
+ cos &theta; <var>r<sub>y</sub></var></p>

<p class=center><var>r<sub>Z</sub></var> = cos &phi; cos &theta; 
<var>r<sub>x</sub></var> + cos &phi; sin &theta; <var>r<sub>y</sub></var> + sin &phi; 
<var>r<sub>z</sub></var></p>

<p>The range to the satellite is</p>

<p class=center><var>r</var> = &radic; [<var>r<sub>S</sub></var><sup>2</sup>
+ <var>r<sub>E</sub></var><sup>2</sup> + <var>r<sub>Z</sub></var><sup>2</sup>],</p>

<p>the elevation is</p>

<p class=center>El = sin<sup>-1</sup>(<var>r<sub>Z</sub></var> / <var>r</var>),</p>

<p>and the azimuth is</p>

<p class=center>Az = tan<sup>-1</sup>(-<var>r<sub>E</sub></var> / <var>r<sub>S</sub></var>).</p>

<p>The minus sign is necessary because azimuth is measured clockwise from North 
instead of counter-clockwise from South (which would be standard for a 
right-handed orthogonal coordinate system). Care must be taken with the azimuth 
to ensure the proper quadrant is selected for the arctangent.</p>

<p>We can calculate the look angles using the procedure described with the 
Pascal procedure <coding>Calculate_Look</coding>, shown below. The inputs are the 
satellite's ECI coordinates (<coding>xs</coding>, <coding>ys,</coding> and 
<coding>zs</coding>) in kilometers, the observer's latitude and longitude 
(<coding>lat</coding> and <coding>lon</coding>) in radians and altitude 
(<coding>alt</coding>) in kilometers, along with the time of interest 
(<coding>time</coding>) as a Julian Date. The outputs are the azimuth and elevation 
(<coding>az</coding> and <coding>el</coding>) in radians and the range (<coding>rg</coding>) 
in kilometers. 

<ul>
<pre>
Procedure Calculate_Look(xs,ys,zs,lat,lon,alt,time : double;
                                      var az,el,rg : double);
  var
    xo,yo,zo,
    rx,ry,rz,
    theta,
    top_s,top_e,top_z : double;
  begin
  Calculate_User_Pos(lat,lon,alt,time,xo,yo,zo);
  theta := Modulus(ThetaG_JD(time) + lon,twopi);
  rx := xs - xo;
  ry := ys - yo;
  rz := zs - zo;
  top_s := Sin(lat)* Cos(theta)*rx
         + Sin(lat)* Sin(theta)*ry
         - Cos(lat)*rz
  top_e := - Sin(theta)*rx
         + Cos(theta)*ry;
  top_z := Cos(lat)* Cos(theta)*rx
         + Cos(lat)* Sin(theta)*ry
         + Sin(lat)*rz;
  az := ArcTan(-top_e/top_s);
  if top_s &gt; 0 then
    az := az + pi;
  if az &lt; 0 then
    az := az + twopi;
  rg := Sqrt(rx*rx + ry*ry + rz*rz);
  el := ArcSin(top_z/rg);
  end; {Procedure Calculate_Look}
</pre>
</ul>

<p>To sum things up, in order to calculate the look angles for a satellite 
relative to an observer on the ground, we must first calculate the satellite's 
position in the ECI coordinate system, then calculate the observer's ECI 
position, take the difference of the two vectors, and then transform (rotate) 
the vector from the ECI coordinate frame to the topocentric-horizon frame. The 
most difficult part of this process is in calculating the Earth's rotation angle 
when determining the observer's position.</p>

<p>Last time, we worked through the process of calculating the ECI 
(Earth-Centered Inertial) coordinates of an observer's position on the Earth's 
surface, starting with the observer's latitude and longitude. Then, we used 
those coordinates to calculate look angles (azimuth and elevation) from the 
observer's position to an orbiting satellite. The most difficult part of that 
process was in calculating the sidereal time, a quantity necessary to determines 
the Earth's orientation in inertial space.</p>

<p>In the process of performing those calculations, however, we made one 
simplifying assumption: that the Earth is a sphere. Unfortunately, this 
assumption is not a good one. Ignoring the fact that the Earth's shape can more 
accurately be described as an oblate spheroid (a flattened sphere) can have a 
significant effect in certain types of satellite tracking applications. In this 
column, we will examine the implications of our initial assumption by modifying 
our calculations to allow for the Earth's flattening at the poles and then 
tackle the related problem of determining the sub-point of an orbiting 
satellite. Let's start by looking at a cross-section of the Earth and defining 
some terms.</p>

<p class=center><img class=auto alt="Figure 1" src="fig-1.gif" width=420 height=400></p>

<p class=center><b>Figure 1. Cross-Section of Oblate Earth</b></p>

<p>Figure 1 is an exaggerated view of the cross-section of the Earth. For an 
observer on the Earth's surface, we can define a couple of terms fairly easily. 
The first is the <i>local zenith</i>. The local zenith direction is just a fancy 
way of saying "straight up." It is the direction away from a point on the 
Earth's surface perpendicular (at a right angle to) the local horizon. On a 
sphere, this direction is always directly away from the Earth's center. However, 
on an oblate spheroid, this is not the case since a line from the center of the 
Earth to the observer's position would not point to the local zenith (except on 
the equator and at the poles).</p>

<p>Since the local zenith direction depends upon the local horizon, let's take 
some time to better define it, as well. The local horizon is a plane which is 
tangent (touching at a point) to the Earth's surface at the observer's position. 
For our purposes, we will consider the local horizon to be the plane tangent to 
the <i>reference spheroid</i>. The term <i>reference spheroid</i> is used to 
define the oblate spheroid which 'best' defines the shape of the Earth. How 
'best' is defined is a complicated process and depends upon whether the fit of 
the reference spheroid is regional or global. We will use the reference spheroid 
defined in WGS-72 (World Geodetic System, 1972) for our standard.</p>

<p>In WGS-72, the Earth's equatorial radius, <i>a</i>, is defined to be 
6,378.135 km. The Earth's polar radius, <i>b</i>, is related to the equatorial 
radius by something called the flattening, <i>f</i>, where</p>

<p class=center><i>b</i> = <i>a</i>(1 - <i>f</i>)</p>

<p>The flattening term, as defined in WGS-72, is only 1/298.26&mdash;a very 
small deviation from a perfect sphere. Using this value, the Earth's polar 
radius would be 6,356.751 km&mdash;only 22 kilometers difference from the 
equatorial radius.</p>

<p>The first real significance of using an oblate spheroid instead of a sphere 
to define the Earth's shape comes in determining the observer's latitude. On a 
sphere, latitude is defined as the angle between the line going from the center 
of the Earth to the observer and the Earth's equatorial plane. However, on an 
oblate spheroid, <i>geodetic latitude</i> is the angle between the local zenith 
direction and the Earth's equatorial plane. This angle, &phi;, is the latitude 
used on maps; the angle formed by the observer's position, the Earth's center, 
and the equatorial plane is more properly referred to as the <i>geocentric 
latitude</i>, &phi;'.</p>

<p>The impact of this change is that in order to calculate the observer's ECI 
position, we must determine the geocentric latitude from the geodetic latitude. 
Knowing the geocentric latitude, &phi;', we can then calculate the geocentric 
radius, &rho;, and from that calculate the <i>z</i> coordinate (&rho; sin 
&phi;') and the projection in the equatorial plane (&rho; cos &phi;'). Let's 
start by developing the relationship between &phi; and &phi;' since we'll 
usually be given &phi;.</p>

<p>From the basic definition of an ellipse,</p>

<p class=center><img class=auto alt="Equation" src="eq-01.gif" width=116 height=44></p>

<p>where</p>

<p class=center><i>R</i>' = &rho; cos(&phi;')</p>

<p>and</p>

<p class=center><i>z</i>' = &rho; sin(&phi;').</p>

<p>Now,</p>

<p class=center>tan(&phi;') = <img align=absmiddle alt="Equation" src="eq-02.gif" width=24 height=41></p>

<p>and</p>

<p class=center>tan(&phi;) = <img align=absmiddle alt="Equation" src="eq-03.gif" width=42 height=41></p>

<p>(that is, the normal to the tangent of the spheroid). Differentiating the equation of
the ellipse,</p>

<p class=center><img class=auto alt="Equation" src="eq-04.gif" width=138 height=41></p>

<p>and rearranging terms,</p>

<p class=center><img class=auto alt="Equation" src="eq-05.gif" width=106 height=44></p>

<p>which can be written as,</p>

<p class=center>tan(&phi;') = <img align=middle alt="Equation" src="eq-06.gif" width=24 height=44>tan(&phi;) =
(1-<i>f</i>)<sup>2</sup> tan(&phi;).</p>

<p>So, knowing the geodetic latitude and the flattening, we can now determine 
the geocentric latitude. Now, let's see how much of a difference results from 
using an oblate spheroid. Figure 2 plots the difference between geodetic and 
geocentric latitude as a function of geodetic latitude.</p>

<p class=center><img class=auto alt="Figure 2" src="fig-2.gif" width=588 height=398></p>

<p class=center><b>Figure 2. Geocentric vs. Geodetic Latitude</b></p>

<p>That's it? All that work and the maximum error is less than two-tenths of a 
degree? It would hardly seem worth the effort to perform the calculation. But 
let's explore a little further.</p>

<p>Although the development is too complicated to present here, it can be shown that</p>

<p class=center>&rho; sin(&phi;') = <i>z</i>' = <i>a S</i> sin(&phi;)</p>

<p>and</p>

<p class=center>&rho; cos(&phi;') = <i>R</i>'
= <i>a C</i> cos(&phi;)</p>

<p>where</p>

<p class=center><img class=auto alt="Equation" src="eq-07.gif" width=190 height=49></p>

<p class=center><img class=auto alt="Equation" src="eq-08.gif" width=104 height=24>.</p>

<p>Our ECI coordinates, are now</p>

<p class=center><i>x</i>' = <i>a C</i> cos(&phi;) cos(&theta;)</p>

<p class=center><i>y</i>' = <i>a C</i> cos(&phi;) sin(&theta;)</p>

<p class=center><i>z</i>' = <i>a S</i> sin(&phi;).</p>

<p>Using the example of calculating the ECI coordinates of 40&deg; N (geodetic) 
latitude, 75&deg; W longitude on 1995 October 01 at 9<sup>h</sup> UTC,</p>

<p class=center><i>x</i>' = 1703.295 km, <i>y</i>' = 4586.650 km, <i>z</i>' =
4077.984 km.</p>

<p>Although close to our calculations assuming a spherical Earth, we find this 
simplification resulted in a position error of 22.8 km.</p>

<p>What we really want to know, however, is just how big an error will result 
when generating look angles to a satellite from an observer's position on the 
Earth's surface if we assume a spherical Earth. From Figure 2, we would expect 
to have the largest errors for observers around 45&deg; N latitude, so let's use 
a location near Minneapolis at 45&deg; N latitude and 93&deg; W longitude for 
our example. On a pass of the Mir space station over Minneapolis on 1995 
November 18, Mir passed almost directly overhead. At 12<sup>h</sup> 
46<sup>m</sup> UTC, its ECI position was calculated to be: <i>x</i> = -4400.594 
km, <i>y</i> = 1932.870 km, <i>z</i> = 4760.712 km. Calculating the look angles 
for both a spherical and oblate Earth yields the results shown in Table 1.</p>

<p>The pointing error produced by assuming a spherical Earth is 3.17 degrees. 
For most applications, this error might not be significant. However, in 
applications involving tracking with high-gain, typically narrow-beamwidth, 
antennas, an error of 3 degrees can result in a loss of communications.</p>

<p>So, now that we've completed the calculation of a satellite look angle for an 
oblate Earth, let's look at how to calculate the sub-point of a satellite in 
Earth orbit. We'll begin by examining the calculations for a spherical Earth 
first before looking at the case for an oblate Earth.</p>

<p>First, let's be sure we understand what we're looking for. The satellite 
sub-point is that point on the Earth's surface directly below the satellite. For 
the case of a spherical Earth, this point is the intersection of the line from 
the center of the Earth to the satellite and the Earth's surface, as shown in 
Figure 3.</p>

<p class=center><img class=auto alt="Figure 3" src="fig-3.gif" width=420 height=400></p>

<p class=center><b>Figure 3. Calculating Satellite Sub-Point&mdash;Spherical Earth</b></p>

<p>Given the ECI position of the satellite to be [<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>], the
latitude is</p>

<p class=center><img class=auto alt="Equation" src="eq-09.gif" width=146 height=58></p>

<p>and the (East) longitude is</p>

<p class=center><img class=auto alt="Equation" src="eq-10.gif" width=130 height=45></p>

<p>where &theta;<sub>g</sub> is the Greenwich Mean Sidereal Time (GMST). The 
altitude of the satellite would be</p>

<p class=center><img class=auto alt="Equation" src="eq-11.gif" width=152 height=29></p>

<p>where <i>R<sub>e</sub></i> is the Earth's circular radius.</p>

<p>As seen in Figure 4, the calculation for an oblate Earth is somewhat more 
complicated. The first thing we notice is that our definition of satellite 
sub-point requires some refinement. The point on the Earth's surface directly 
below the satellite is not on a line joining the satellite and the center of the 
Earth. Instead, it is that point on the Earth's surface where the satellite 
would appear at the zenith.</p>

<p class=center><img class=auto alt="Figure 4" src="fig-4.gif" width=420 height=400></p>

<p class=center><b>Figure 4. Calculating Satellite Sub-Point&mdash;Oblate Earth</b></p>

<p>Calculating the longitude of the satellite's sub-point doesn't change. 
However, to calculate the geodetic latitude of the satellite sub-point, we'll 
want to begin by approximating &phi; with &phi;' (as calculated above) and 
letting <img align=absmiddle alt="Equation" src="eq-12.gif" width=90 height=24> 
(for computational efficiency). Then, we'll want to loop through the following 
calculations</p>

<p class=center><img class=auto alt="Equation" src="eq-13.gif" width=45 height=21></p>

<p class=center><img class=auto alt="Equation" src="eq-14.gif" width=145 height=49></p>

<p class=center><img class=auto alt="Equation" src="eq-15.gif" width=188 height=50></p>

<p>until <img align=absmiddle alt="Equation" src="eq-16.gif" width=48 height=28> 
is within the desired tolerance. To compute the altitude of the satellite above 
the sub-point,</p>

<p class=center><img class=auto alt="Equation" src="eq-17.gif" width=108 height=44>.</p>

<p>Using our example of Mir passing over Minneapolis on 1995 November 18 at 
12<sup>h</sup> 46<sup>m</sup> UTC yields a sub-point at 44.91&deg; N (geodetic) 
latitude, 92.31&deg; W longitude, and 397.507 km altitude. And while we cannot 
solve for the sub-point directly, the number of iterations required is typically 
quite small. For this example, the value of <img align=absmiddle alt="Equation" 
src="eq-16.gif" width=48 height=28> after the first iteration is 0.180537 
degrees, after the second iteration it's 0.000574 degrees, and after the third 
iteration it's 0.000002 degrees.</p>

<p>Admittedly, some of the differences we've found may seem small, but that will 
depend upon your tracking requirements. And, since they are not that much more 
difficult to calculate, there is little reason not to use them. As always, if 
you have questions or comments on this column, feel free to send me e-mail at

<p>Throughout the development of this column, we have been faced with two 
inescapable conclusions: satellite tracking can be computationally intensive and 
requires careful attention to ensure accurate results. These conclusions are 
inescapable regardless of whether you are developing your own satellite tracking 
software or using someone else's.</p>

<p>As a result of these conclusions, it becomes important at some point to 
consider the issue of benchmarks to assess certain performance characteristics 
of any satellite tracking system. As we shall see, benchmarks can be used for a 
variety of purposes: evaluating the performance of a particular hardware 
configuration, operating system, programming language, or specific satellite 
tracking application. Which consideration&mdash;speed or accuracy&mdash;is most 
important to you will depend upon your needs, but we will address several 
approaches to assess each.</p>

<p>Which benchmark is best to use depends heavily on the application. In the 
area of satellite tracking, we would expect the best benchmarks to be 
floating-point intensive, that is, to make heavy use of real calculations as opposed to 
integer calculations. We would also expect them to make heavy use of 
trigonometric and other mathematical functions. While we could use existing 
standard benchmarks, the drawback to this approach is that often it is not clear 
what the basis of the benchmark calculation is and, hence, how appropriate it is 
to assessing the performance of a particular class of applications.</p>

<p>This column (and the next) will endeavor to provide you with a suite of 
benchmarks that are not only simple but will also allow you to assess 
performance across the spectrum of operations. We will begin by developing a set 
of benchmarks with known solutions. The easiest of these is something known as 
the Savage benchmark.</p>

<p>The Savage benchmark is a particularly good benchmark for the fields of 
satellite tracking and astronomy. The reason it is so good is that it relies 
entirely on the repeated use of mathematical functions which yield a known (and 
easily calculable) numerical result. This benchmark is based on the use of 
matching inverse mathematical functions. Sample code, written for Borland Pascal 
7.0, is provided in figure 1 below. Note that units from the <a 
href="/software/satellite/sgp4-plb26a.zip">SGP4 Pascal Library</a> have been 
used to time the calculation.</p>

<p>The heart of the calculation consists of taking the variable <coding>a</coding>, 
starting with a value of one, and incrementing it by one 2,499 times until 
<coding>a</coding> = 2,500. To make things more interesting, though, we evaluate 
<coding>a</coding> using a set of three matching inverse functions: square and 
square root, exponential and logarithm, and tangent and arc tangent. The result 
of each pair of matching inverse functions <i>should</i> be the original value 
of <coding>a</coding> and the result of all the calculations should equal exactly 
2,500. Of course, due to limitations of the hardware, operating system, and 
programming language the result will not yield exactly the expected result. How 
close we get to the approved solution and how quickly we can calculate it are 
the two dimensions of this benchmark. Table 1 shows the results for a range of 
systems in current use for differing levels of numerical precision.</p>

<p>The results are actually rather illuminating. Even the slowest machine beats 
the time of a Cray X-MP/24 from a decade ago.<a href="#NOTE1"><small><sup>1</sup></small></a> 
And while the accuracy isn't quite as high as with the Cray, the adoption of 
standards for numerical processing has resulted in consistent results for 
standard data types. Finally, the use of numeric coprocessors allows high 
precision (certainly compared to the single-precision results) for very little 
additional time.</p>

<p>How might this benchmark be used? Well, because of its 
simplicity&mdash;relying entirely on number crunching&mdash;it can be used to 
demonstrate anything from the 18-fold improvement in performance going from a 
386DX-33 to a Pentium 133, to the difference in programming languages (e.g., 
Pascal vs. C), or even the differences between operating systems (e.g., Windows 
95 vs. Unix). The Savage benchmark is a straightforward way of assessing the 
kind of computational speed and accuracy required for satellite tracking 
precisely because it avoids measuring things like disk throughput or video 
performance.</p>

<p>Let's put aside the issue of speed for a moment and address the issue of 
accuracy. Of course, we've been assessing accuracy throughout the history of 
this column. Each time we've presented the theory behind a particular aspect of 
satellite tracking, we've followed up with a specific numerical example to 
ensure you can implement the theory from start to finish. These examples are 
usually fairly simple because we're only looking at a small piece of the larger 
picture. However, as we pull these smaller pieces together, it becomes 
increasingly important to be able to assess the accuracy of the resulting 
complex procedures. We do this through the use of standard test cases.</p>

<p>An example of a standard test case would be to provide element sets for a 
particular orbital model (e.g., NORAD two-line element sets for the SGP4 orbital 
model) and the output from a known correct implementation of the orbital model. 
An example of such test cases is included in the appendix of
<a href="/NORAD/documentation/spacetrk.pdf"><i>Spacetrack Report Number 
3</i></a>.<a href="#NOTE2"><small><sup>2</sup></small></a> The sample test cases in this report 
include an element set for one near-earth and one deep-space satellite and the 
resulting SGP4 state vectors (ECI position and velocity) at points over a 
specific time interval. These test cases can be used to verify the proper 
implementation of the SGP4 (near-earth) and SDP4 (deep-space) portions of the 
current NORAD orbital model for a particular satellite tracking application.</p>

<p>For example, we can verify the implementation of the SGP4 model used by 
<a href="/software/satellite/trakstar26a.zip"><i>TrakStar</i></a> by running the 
code in figure 2 with the data in 
<a href="/NORAD/documentation/spacetrk.pdf"><i>Spacetrack Report Number 
3</i></a> (included in the code).</p>

<p>The results show agreement at the meter-level in position and 
millimeter/second-level in velocity. Most of the disparity comes from 
refinements to the constants used in the model together with modifications to 
the code since its initial release. Obviously, it is important to have good 
current test cases to use to verify your software. Perhaps not so obvious is the 
need to have a more diverse set of orbital elements to test against. Such a set 
would go further toward testing all aspects of the complicated SGP4 model and 
provide better confidence in a particular implementation.</p>

<p>Now that we have at least a basic means of assessing the overall accuracy of 
a particular implementation of an orbital model, let's return to the question of 
speed. Our ultimate benchmark would be to run a standard set of orbital 
elements&mdash;for satellites in various orbits&mdash;over a specific interval 
and count how many state vectors can be computed per unit time. That is exactly 
what SGP4-BM does. The code in figure 3 is run with the NORAD two-line orbital 
elements in figure 4 to calculate the state vectors for each satellite at 
one-minute intervals for the entire day of 1993 March 11. By measuring how long it 
takes to do these 14,400 calculations, we come up with a figure of how many SGP4 
calculations per minute are computed.</p>

<p>It should be obvious that this benchmark is best suited to determining the 
number-crunching ability of any satellite tracking system since that is exactly 
what it tests. Interestingly enough, though, we see the same 18-fold improvement 
between the 386DX-33 and the Pentium 133 with SGP4-BM as we did with the much 
simpler Savage benchmark.</p>

<p>If you think we haven't quite finished our discussion of satellite tracking 
benchmarks yet, you're absolutely right. While we've looked at system 
benchmarks, we haven't even addressed the need for benchmarking against 
real-world data. System benchmarks can only verify that our application is 
consistent with existing models but cannot validate that the application 
actually works. Next time we'll look at some real-world data sets and see how to 
test an application against that data using <i>TrakStar</i> as an example. We 
will also discuss various types of real-world data which may be used for this 
purpose, depending on your requirements.</p>

<p class=center><b>Figure 1. New <i>Celestial WWW</i> Home Page.</b></p>

<p>A lot can change between columns here at <i>Satellite Times</i>. Last time, 
we began a series of articles on benchmarking of satellite tracking software and 
were supposed to finish it up in this issue. Little did I realize as we were 
putting that last issue to press that by the time I got around to writing the 
next one, I'd be doing so from a new house.</p>

<p>Moving is always a great opportunity for change. It forces changes in 
patterns that we've grown accustomed to&mdash;sometimes whether we like it or 
not. Of course, every time I've moved since 1985, one of the big changes has 
been to quickly set up the <i>Celestial BBS</i> at its new home. Over the years, 
the <i>Celestial BBS</i>&mdash;a major source of orbital elements and satellite 
tracking software&mdash;has moved from Sunnyvale, CA to Austin, TX to Fairborn, 
OH to Wright-Patterson AFB, OH and finally to Montgomery, AL.</p>

<p>At first, it seemed that this move would be a relatively painless one for the 
BBS. After all, we were only moving a distance of a mile or so and could 
actually transfer the telephone number. Except for a couple of hours to pack 
everything, move it, and set it back up, it looked like it could be done without 
much impact on the BBS's users.</p>

<p>We hit the first snag, however, when we discovered that the new house was 
only wired for two lines. Since my wife and I both do a lot of work at home and 
most of it has some aspect of remote communications, we already needed both 
lines. Having <i>BellSouth</i> come out and install a new line would add cost 
and cause delay of a week in getting the new BBS back up and operating.</p>

<p>That's when I began to realize it was time to consider Plan B. Traffic on the 
<i>Celestial BBS</i> had been dropping precipitously as the popularity of the 
Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW) rocketed. From an average daily high of 70 
calls a day (and 100-130 calls a day during many US space shuttle 
missions&mdash;not bad for a one-line BBS), traffic had dropped to only a 
handful of calls each day. Many users were getting the data via <i>anonymous 
ftp</i> at archive.afit.af.mil in the <i>pub/space</i> directory <i>[this site 
is no longer available] </i>and wondering why they couldn't access the rest of 
the material from the <i>Celestial BBS</i> via the Internet. Many of these users 
were looking for ways to avoid considerable long-distance charges while calling 
from places as far away as Australia and Japan.</p>

<p>The solution, of course, seemed obvious. Why not set up a WWW site to replace 
the BBS? After all, that would avoid the need to install a new telephone line 
and allow me to begin operation before the BBS shut down. It would also remove 
many of the problems with BBS operations, such as noisy phone lines or system 
lock ups while I was away from home. In addition, I would avoid major hardware 
and software upgrades which were needed to remove some operating limitations 
(the <i>Celestial BBS</i> was still running on a 386 machine running <i>MS-DOS</i>).</p>

<p>A WWW site seemed the ideal solution. After all, I am responsible for (and do 
a lot of development on) the Air University WWW home page 
(<a target="_BLANK" href="http://www.au.af.mil/">http://www.au.af.mil/</a>)&mdash;one of the 
largest WWW systems in the US Air Force. Writing in HTML (HyperText Markup 
Language) had become second nature and I had some pretty good ideas of how to 
start off. Plus, our local Internet service provider (ISP) offered personal home 
pages as part of their package.</p>

<p>Well, Plan B didn't get too far when I began to realize that the five free 
megabytes of transfers a day offered by our ISP wouldn't be nearly enough to 
support the traffic I anticipated for such a site. In fact, that would only be 
about a hundred downloads a day of the master two-line orbital elements list. 
I've always been a strong proponent of free access to information and believe 
the payback for operating the BBS out of pocket, with the generous donations of 
a few financial supporters, has been instrumental in helping satellite tracking 
to evolve to where we are today. The thought of charging for access put a major 
crimp in Plan B.</p>

<p><b>Grove to the Rescue</b></p>

<p>That's where the great folks at <i>GroveLink</i> and <i>Satellite Times</i> 
came to my rescue. I approached them with a proposal to host the WWW site for 
the <i>Celestial BBS</i> on their new WWW server. Having immediate access to the 
most current orbital element sets for the <i>Satellite Times</i> readers would 
be a real plus. And what better column than <i>Computers &amp; Satellites</i> to 
kick it off. To my delight, they were every bit as enthusiastic about the idea 
as I was! As a result, within a matter of days, we had the new <i>Celestial 
WWW</i> site stood up and operating at http://www.grove.net/~tkelso/ <i>[now at 
<a target="_BLANK" href="http://celestrak.org">http://celestrak.org</a>,
the CelesTrak WWW site]</i>.</p>

<p><b>A Guided Tour</b></p>

<p>The initial design of the <i>Celestial WWW</i> is pretty basic right now, 
providing primarily NORAD two-line orbital element sets and some supporting 
documentation. Even at that, though, the site is receiving 100-150 hits a day. 
Let's take a quick look at what's already available before talking about what's 
to come.</p>

<p>The home page will be the stepping-off point for our tour. The adventure 
begins right below the newly-designed logo for the WWW site (see Figure 1). 
Besides having links to our hosts and an easy way to send me feedback, ask 
questions, or make suggestions, there are currently three major sections to the 
site (see Figure 2): 

<ul>
  <li>Current Data</li>
  <li>Historical Archives</li>
  <li>Documentation</li>
</ul>

<table class=center border=3 width=450>
  <tr>
    <th colspan=3>NORAD Two-Line Element Sets</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class=center width=150><a href="/NORAD/elements/">Current Data</a></td>
    <td class=center width=150><a href="/NORAD/archives/">Historical Archives</a></td>

  </tr>
</table>
<br>
<p class=center><b>Figure 2. Links to NORAD Two-Line Element Sets.</b></p>

<p>The <a href="/NORAD/elements/"><i>Current Data</i></a> page contains just 
that: the most current data from the NORAD two-line orbital element sets. This 
data is normally updated every US government work day. The master list contains 
orbital data for a wide range of satellites&mdash;everything from amateur radio 
satellites to constellations such as GPS, Glonass, GOES, and many others. In 
addition, it also includes element sets for all new launches for the first 
thirty days after they are catalogued, making the data available as soon as 
possible after launch.</p>

<p>Perhaps more useful are the functional element sets which cover specific 
groups of satellites&mdash;amateur radio, weather, navigation, and various 
geosynchronous constellations (see Figure 4). These sets make it easy for users 
to quickly find the data they need. Of particular note are the special-interest 
element sets near the top of the page&mdash;element sets for things like the Mir 
space station, US space shuttle missions (while on orbit), and other satellites 
which are making the news (such as TSS&nbsp;1&mdash;the tethered satellite that 
got away from STS 76).</p>

<p>All of the two-line element sets are formatted using the standard <i>MS-DOS</i> 
format where each line ends with a carriage return/line feed (CR/LF). This 
should make the process of downloading the elements, for direct use in various 
satellite tracking packages, pretty straightforward.</p>

<p>The <a href="/NORAD/archives/"><i>Historical Archives</i></a> are a treasure 
trove of information for many satellite users. Do you need orbital data for a 
weather or earth resources satellite (e.g., NOAA or Landsat) in order to 
geolocate an image? Well, you can find those and much more in this section. 
Historical element sets are available for various classes of satellite missions 
(e.g., weather and earth resources) from 1980 to the present. In most cases, 
this means that you can find <i>all</i> the two-line element sets generated for 
a particular satellite since launch!</p>

<p>Maybe you don't need every element set for these satellites. Instead, you're 
simply looking for element sets for 1994 for NOAA 11. At the bottom of the <a 
href="/NORAD/archives/"><i>Historical Archives</i></a> page are links to yearly 
archives for each of the satellites on this page. To find the 1994 data for NOAA 
11, simply click on '<a href="/NORAD/archives/">1994</a>' and then click on 
'NOAA 11' in the 'NOAA' section of the 'Weather Satellites' table.</p>

<p>All this data wouldn't be of much use without appropriate documentation and 
that's where the final section comes in. The 
<a href="/NORAD/documentation/"><i>Documentation</i></a> page presently contains 
some fundamental information for using the NORAD two-line element sets. The 
first item is a description of the NORAD two-line element set format. While most 
satellite tracking software already knows how to translate the two-line element 
set at input, users are often curious as to what each field represents. Here's 
where you can find out.</p>

<p>Of course, you should remember that you still need to use the NORAD SGP4 
orbital model with these data to get the most accurate results. Orbital elements 
such eccentricity do not have exactly the same mathematical meaning in different 
orbital models and the user should not assume otherwise. For a complete 
description of the NORAD orbital models, including FORTRAN source code, look at 
the link titled 
<a href="/NORAD/documentation/spacetrk.pdf"><i>Project Spacetrack Report Number 3</i></a>.</p>

<p>You may notice that the format of this document is different than what you're 
used to. Many documents you'll find on the WWW are in either HTML or plain ASCII 
text. But this report contains many mathematical equations used to describe the 
various orbital models and neither HTML or ASCII can adequately represent these 
equations. Enter the portable document format (PDF) created by <i>Adobe</i> (the 
creators of <i>PostScript</i>) called 
<a target="_BLANK" href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/"><i>Acrobat</i></a>. This 
format permits true WYSIWYG on the WWW and 
<a target="_BLANK" href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html"><b>free</b> 
viewers</a> are available from <i>Adobe</i> for not only <i>Microsoft 
Windows</i> but <i>Macintosh</i> and <i>Unix</i> platforms, as well. Links for

to download the 
<a target="_BLANK" href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html"><i>Acrobat</i> 
viewers</a> are included on this page.</p>

<p>The <a href="/NORAD/documentation/"><i>Documentation</i></a> section also 
provides links to some timely information about recent and upcoming satellite 
launches. The <a target="_BLANK" href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacewarn/"><i>SPACEWARN 
Bulletin</i></a> is a monthly publication which gives basic information about 
each satellite launch. The site maintained by the <i>Committee on Space Research 
(COSPAR)</i> contains archives of these bulletins going back several years. 
<a target="_BLANK" href="http://www.planet4589.org/space/jsr/jsr.html"><i>Jonathan's 
Space Report</i></a> is a weekly newsletter with information on current 
launches, decays, and discussion of various satellite news items. It is an 
excellent resource for staying up on what's in orbit.</p>

<p><b>Plans For the Future</b></p>

<p>It may seem that the <i>Celestial WWW</i> already has quite a lot of 
information, but we've only just begun! Let me leave you with just a hint of 
things to come. One of the major items currently missing from the system are the 
vast software archives on satellites and astronomy which were available via the 
<i>Celestial BBS</i>. I will be reviewing those archives and either putting the 
programs online or adding links to the most current versions. Obviously, this 
will be a major effort, but one that should be well worth the effort.</p>

<p>In the <i>Historical Archives</i> section, we'll be adding a form for special 
requests. While the current archives are quite extensive, I'm sure many users 
will have special requirements and we want to be able to respond to special 
requests in a timely fashion. Once the form is online, you'll know we're ready 
to supply this service.</p>

<p>Help and additional reference materials will be a major addition to the new 
site. Soon, there will be a <i>Help</i> page which mirrors the <i>Current 
Data</i> page. Here, when you click on NOAA 11, you'll find links to basic 
information describing the satellite, operating frequencies, operational status, 
images, and other related information. The Internet is a gold mine of such 
information, but finding what you need can be tough. We hope to tie it all 
together for you.</p>

<p>Of course, being a professor, one of my basic missions is education. Past 
issues of this column have served as a basic tutorial on satellite tracking and 
will continue to do so. For those of you who have missed some of the earlier 
issues, I'll be putting them out in <i>Adobe Acrobat</i> format to serve 
as a major reference. And, to supplement these issues, I'll provide the source 
code and executables discussed in my columns (such as our last issue) to help 
you follow along. I'll also be building a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) list 
to address basic recurring issues.</p>

<p>One final note on the technology. While the tables on the new Celestial WWW 
look best under Netscape Navigator 2.0 because of its incorporation of the HTML 
3.0 standards for tables, this browser, with its plug-ins, will allow us to push 
the envelope with new technologies like <i>Java</i>, <i>Amber</i> (an enhanced 
<i>Acrobat</i>), and <i>VRML</i>. Imagine interactive demonstrations of basic 
orbital theory to help you get up to speed on a particular topic&mdash;it's 
coming!</p>

<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>

<p>Hopefully, the things we've just discussed will make it easier for you to 
learn about and understand orbital mechanics and to get the software and data to 
be able to apply what you've learned. Of course, it isn't a substitute for 
<i>Satellite Times</i> (it's still hard to do this Internet stuff while waiting 
in the doctor's office), which has a wealth of other outstanding material, but I 
think you'll find it provides considerable enhancement to each issue.</p>

<p>As always, if you have questions or comments on this column, feel free to 
send me e-mail at my <i>new</i> e-mail address: 
<a href="mailto:TS.Kelso@celestrak.org">TS.Kelso@celestrak.org</a>
or write care 
of <i>Satellite Times</i>. And be sure to let the folks at <i>Satellite 
Times</i> know how you feel about the new WWW site and thank them for their 
support. Until next time, keep looking up!</p>

<p>One of the most satisfying aspects of satellite predictions comes when you 
get to actually test out your satellite tracking software. It's one thing to 
have a slick software interface with lots of bells and whistles, showing where 
the satellite should be on a world map&mdash;it's quite another to point your 
antenna at the horizon and pick up your favorite satellite right on 
schedule.</p>

<p>Of course, humans tend to be visual creatures. We are often told how things 
work, but we want to see for ourselves. As the old saying goes, "Seeing is 
believing." The same is true for satellite predictions. From the earliest days 
of the Space Age, observers have looked up in the early evening sky to search 
for small points of light silently speeding through the heavens. From Echo 1 in 
the early 1960s to the Mir Space Station and the US Space Shuttle today, there 
is an endless fascination with being able to predict an event in the heavens and 
then watch it occur like clockwork.</p>

<p><b>A Bit of History</b></p>

<p>In fact, many of us have started professional careers from just such a 
foundation&mdash;myself included. I can still clearly remember that day in 1979 
when I went out in my backyard to watch for Skylab to pass overhead. Skylab was 
getting lots of attention then because of the imminent decay of its orbit and 
the local television station in Kansas City (70 miles away) reported a 
particularly good pass would be visible that evening. I called some friends and 
we drug my <i>Celestron 8</i> telescope and some binoculars out in the backyard 
at the appointed hour and waited&mdash;we were not to be disappointed. Just as 
advertised, a bright light rose out of the western twilight and slowly slipped 
across the sky.</p>

<p>Of course, I wanted to be able to look at Skylab through the lens of my 
<i>Celestron 8</i> and track it across the sky, but it moved too quickly and 
there was no way to know exactly where to look. After all, the field of view of 
this telescope is only about half a degree&mdash;the width of the sun or the 
moon. Even to have Skylab simply pass through the field of view would take some 
pretty accurate calculations&mdash;a lot more than we got from the local 
weatherman.</p>

<p>As Skylab passed from sight, my mind was buzzing with all sorts of questions, 
not the least of which was: "Couldn't I do this myself?" After all, I had just 
bought my first computer a year earlier, a <i>TRS-80 Model I</i>, and by now we 
had some reasonably sophisticated programming tools (BASIC and FORTRAN) 
available on that platform. Couldn't I write a program which would tell me where 
to look to find a given satellite?</p>

<p>My initial impression at the time was that this would be fairly 
straightforward. After all, I already understood basic two-body Keplerian orbits 
and had enrolled in an MBA program at the University of Missouri to get access 
to the <i>IBM 360</i> so that I could develop some FORTRAN code to predict the 
positions of the planets (in my spare time) and it worked reasonably well. It 
shouldn't be too difficult to adapt to this code to tracking earth satellites. 
But it seems things are never as easy as they first appear.</p>

<p>The first problem was getting orbital elements. It was one thing back then to 
go to the library and find a book with orbital elements for the planets&mdash;it 
was entirely another story to find a source for orbital elements for earth 
satellites. It wasn't until 1981 that I discovered that NASA distributed these 
on paper via the USPS and that you could get on distribution for up to 
<i>twenty</i> satellites.</p>

<p>Having the element sets before then probably wouldn't have done much good, 
though. The two-line element set format had a somewhat different set of 
Keplerian elements than what I was used to and&mdash;as many of you have 
discovered&mdash;won't produce particularly accurate predictions using a simple 
two-body orbital model. That's because the simple model ignores perturbations, 
such as precession of the nodes or atmospheric drag, in each satellite's orbit 
which causes the orbit to vary with time.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I found out about the NASA source for orbital elements when I 
purchased a BASIC program for the <i>TRS-80 Model I</i> called <i>SAT TRAK</i>. 
Written by William N. Barker and David G. Cooke, it actually implemented the 
NORAD SGP orbital model. It wasn't until I attempted to convert their code to 
use double precision variables that I discovered from my friend, Robert Boren, 
that the <i>SAT TRAK</i> code was actually a BASIC version of the FORTRAN code 
used by NORAD and he got me a copy of 
<a href="/NORAD/documentation/spacetrk.pdf"><i>Project Spacetrack Report Number 
3</i></a> which detailed this model. I spent a good part of the next 15 years 
making these element sets available electronically and getting people to 
understand that accurate predictions demanded that these element sets be used in 
conjunction with the SGP4 orbital model.</p>

<p>Today, access to the NORAD two-line orbital element sets and the 
corresponding SGP4/SDP4 orbital models is easy&mdash;all you need to do is point 
your WWW browser to 
<a href="http://celestrak.org">http://celestrak.org</a>.
Current data, free software, and an 
<a target="_BLANK" href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/"><i>Adobe Acrobat</i></a> 
version of <a href="/NORAD/documentation/spacetrk.pdf"><i>Project Spacetrack 
Report Number 3</i></a> are all available at this site. In addition, orbital 
element sets are available at hundreds of sites worldwide and almost all 
satellite tracking software includes the NORAD SGP4 model&mdash;all thanks to a 
visual pass of the Skylab space station.</p>

<p><b>The Underlying Physics</b></p>

<p>But knowing where a satellite is going to be is only part of the story. A 
visual satellite pass requires a number of additional circumstances, without 
which you won't be able to see the satellite. These are: 

<ul>
  <li>The satellite must be above the observer's horizon.</li>
  <li>The sun must be below the observer's horizon enough to darken the sky.</li>
  <li>The satellite must be illuminated by the sun.</li>
</ul>

<p>We covered how to determine whether a satellite is above the horizon in a 
series of <a href="/columns/">columns</a> on <i>Orbital Coordinate Systems</i> 
from the September/October 1995 to the January/February 1996 issues of this 
magazine. To determine whether a pass satisfies the other requirements means we 
first need to know where the sun is.</p>

<p>How accurately the position of the sun must be determined depends upon the 
application. In most cases, the algorithm described in Chapter 24 of Jean 
Meeus's book 
<a target="_BLANK" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0943396352/8457-7991521-393883"><i>Astronomical
Algorithms</i></a> will work quite nicely. The low-accuracy algorithm is 
accurate to 0.01 degree (a little over one percent of the sun's diameter) and 
can be calculated fairly quickly. The end result will need to be converted to 
ECI (Earth-centered inertial) coordinates in the same frame as we use for the 
satellite and observer's position (this is already done for you in my SGP4 
Pascal Library 
(<a href="/software/satellite/sgp4-plb26a.zip"><i>sgp4-plb26a.zip</i></a>) in the 
routine <i>solar.pas</i>).</p>

<p>Calculating the position of the sun relative to the observer once its 
position in the ECI coordinate system is known is fairly straightforward. We 
simply substitute the sun's position for the satellite's position in the 
equations we developed in 
<a href="/columns/v02n03/"><i>Orbital Coordinate Systems, Part III</i></a>. In 
fact, all we really care about is the sun's elevation above (or below) the 
horizon.</p>

<p>The next question we must answer is: Just how far below the horizon does the 
sun have to be for the observer's sky to be dark? Well, the sun has to be 50 
arcminutes below the horizon for it to be considered to have set (all of these 
results apply equally to sunrise conditions). Part of this angle is due to the 
semidiameter of the sun (about 16 arcminutes)&mdash;even without the atmosphere, 
when the center of the sun is on the horizon, half of its disk is still above 
the horizon.</p>

<p>The rest of this angle (about 34 arcminutes) is due to atmospheric 
refraction. In fact, when the sun's disk appears to be just touching the 
horizon, it is actually completely below the horizon. The earth's atmosphere, 
however, refracts the sun's image enough to make it appear to still be above the 
horizon. The point when the sun's center is 50 arcminutes below the horizon is 
considered to be the official time of sunset (or sunrise) and is the beginning 
(or end) of civil twilight. As you know, however, the sky is still quite bright 
at this point and no stars can be seen.</p>

<p>The point when stars (or satellites) begin to become visible marks the 
beginning of nautical twilight&mdash;when the sun's center is 6 degrees below 
the observer's horizon. Whenever the sun is more than 6 degrees below the 
horizon, it should be fairly easy to spot an illuminated earth satellite. The 
sun's effect on the night sky continues until the end of astronomical twilight 
when (if) it reaches 18 degrees below the horizon and the indirect light from 
the sun is less than the contribution from starlight. Of course, sky brightness 
and atmospheric refraction are influenced by actual meteorological conditions, 
so there may be some variance in the actual versus the predicted times.</p>

<p>To determine whether a satellite is illuminated is a little trickier. As seen 
in Figure 1, because the sun's disk is not a point of light, it does not cast a 
sharp shadow. There are actually two areas of shadow that trail the earth in the 
anti-solar direction. That cone where no portion of the sun's surface can be 
seen is referred to as the umbra. The tail of this cone reaches over a million 
kilometers beyond the earth (well past the orbit of the moon, thus giving rise 
to total lunar eclipses). The angle of this cone is somewhat affected by 
atmospheric refraction and may vary.</p>

<p class=center><img class=auto alt="Figure 1" src="fig-1.gif" width=606 height=276></p>

<p class=center><b>Figure 1. Earth-Sun Shadow Geometry</b></p>

<p>The shadow cone where only part of the sun's disk is obscured by the earth is 
referred to as the penumbra. This shadow is not a sharp transition, but rather a 
gradual transition from full sunlight to full darkness. For near-earth 
satellites, the transition across the penumbra occurs fairly quickly due to the 
smaller size (note that Figure 1 is <i>not</i> drawn to scale) and faster speed 
of the satellites.</p>

<p>To determine whether a satellite is in umbral or penumbral eclipse requires 
several simple calculations. First, we must determine the distances from the 
satellite to the earth (&rho;<sub>E</sub>), the satellite to the sun 
(&rho;<sub>S</sub>), and the earth to the sun (<i>r</i><sub>S</sub>). These 
distances are simple vector distances determined from knowing the position of 
the satellite and the sun in the ECI coordinate system. The geometry is shown in 
Figure 2.</p>

<p class=center><img class=auto alt="Figure 2" src="fig-2.gif" width=614 height=299></p>

<p class=center><b>Figure 2. Satellite-Earth-Sun Geometry</b></p>

<p>From these values, we can then determine the semidiameters of the earth and 
the sun (&theta;<sub>E</sub> and &theta;<sub>S</sub>, respectively) and the 
angle between the center of the earth and the sun (&theta;), all from the 
vantage point of the satellite. The semidiameters are calculated as</p>

<p class=center>&theta;<sub>E</sub> = sin<sup>-1</sup>(<i>R</i><sub>E</sub>/&rho;<sub>E</sub>)</p>

<p class=center>&theta;<sub>S</sub> = sin<sup>-1</sup>(<i>R</i><sub>S</sub>/&rho;<sub>S</sub>)</p>

<p>where <i>R</i><sub>E</sub> and <i>R</i><sub>S</sub> are the radii of the 
earth and the sun, respectively. The angle between the center of the earth and 
the sun is calculated as</p>

<p class=center>&theta; = cos<sup>-1</sup>(<b>&rho;</b><sub>E</sub>&#149;<b>&rho;</b><sub>S</sub>/&rho;<sub>E</sub>&rho;<sub>S</sub>)</p>

<p>where the numerator is the vector dot product of the two distance vectors.</p>

<p>To have an umbral eclipse, the semidiameter of the earth must be greater than 
the semidiameter of the sun (not equal due to atmospheric refraction) and the 
angle between their centers must be less than the difference in their 
semidiameters. That is</p>

<p class=center>&theta;<sub>E</sub> &gt; &theta;<sub>S</sub></p>

<p class=center>&theta; &lt; &theta;<sub>E</sub> - &theta;<sub>S</sub></p>

<p>An example of this geometry is shown on the left-hand side of Figure 3.</p>

<p class=center><img class=auto alt="Figure 3" src="fig-3.gif" width=492 height=265></p>

<p class=center><b>Figure 3. Umbral and Penumbral Eclipse</b></p>

<p>For a penumbral eclipse, the angle between the centers of the earth and the 
sun must be less than the sum of their semidiameters (the two disks are just 
touching) and greater than their differences (the beginning of an umbral 
eclipse). In the penumbral phase, though, there is no requirement that the 
semidiameter of the earth be greater than that of the sun. However, since this 
will be the case for all orbits within the moon's orbit, this condition will be 
the rule. The requirements for a penumbral eclipse are</p>

<p class=center>|&theta;<sub>E</sub> - &theta;<sub>S</sub>|
&lt; &theta; &lt; &theta;<sub>E</sub> + &theta;<sub>S</sub></p>

<p>An example of this geometry is shown on the right-hand side of Figure 3. If 
the semidiameter of the earth is larger than the sun under these conditions, a 
partial eclipse occurs. The condition when </p>

<p class=center>&theta;<sub>S</sub> &gt; &theta;<sub>E</sub></p>

<p class=center>&theta; &lt; &theta;<sub>S</sub> - &theta;<sub>E</sub></p>

<p>however, describes an annular eclipse.</p>

<p>To adapt an existing satellite tracking program to show eclipse conditions 
becomes a fairly straightforward problem. At each time step, the program must 
calculate the position of the sun in the ECI coordinate system, the position of 
the satellite in the ECI coordinate system (this should already be done), and 
the distance from the satellite to the sun. Then, the semidiameters of the earth 
and sun are calculated, together with the angle between their centers. Using the 
simple boolean conditions above, it is easy to determine whether the satellite 
is in full sunlight, totally eclipsed, or somewhere in between.</p>

<p>To determine whether a satellite is visible from the ground only requires the 
additional step of calculating the sun's elevation relative to the observer. If 
the sun is more than 6 degrees below the observer's horizon and the satellite is 
above the horizon and illuminated, a visual pass is possible (weather 
permitting). It should now be possible for you to determine when a satellite 
pass is visible and even when it will fade into the earth's shadow!</p>

<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>

<p>Obviously, there are a number of other factors involved in determining good 
satellite passes. Size of the satellite and its distance from the observer play 
an important role. But understanding the fundamentals will not only make it 
possible to view earth-orbiting satellites, it will also help you understand 
things like eclipse seasons for geostationary satellites.</p>

<p>If you'd like more information on this subject, I invite you to attend my 
session entitled "Visually Observing Earth Satellites" at the upcoming Grove 
Expo in Atlanta on 18-20 October. We'll cover it all from the basics to advanced 
topics. Hope to see you there!</p>

</table>

<p>In our previous column on benchmarking (March/April 1996, pp. 80-81), we 
discussed three issues of particular significance to benchmarking: relevancy, 
speed, and accuracy. While most users are well aware of the need for benchmarks 
to report both speed and accuracy, it is also extremely important that the 
benchmark used be relevant to the type(s) of applications the system 
supports.</p>

<p>For satellite tracking applications, we showed that fairly simple system 
benchmarks, such as the Savage benchmark, can give a pretty good idea of the 
relative performance&mdash;both in speed and accuracy&mdash;of the system 
hardware, operating system, and application software (most notably the 
compiler). A more thorough demonstration of application performance was shown 
using an SGP4-based benchmark (that is, a benchmark based upon the NORAD SGP4 
orbital model) which calculates the positions of a set of ten satellites at 
one-minute intervals throughout an entire day. The satellites were chosen to be 
representative of a wide range of orbit types. The time taken to calculate the 
14,400 predictions is used to determine the average throughput of the particular 
system (hardware, OS, and compiler) together with the specific implementation of 
the orbital model. An even better implementation would not only calculate the 
throughput but also calculate the average error relative to an expected 
result.</p>

<p>While this previous discussion of benchmarking served to give us a good idea 
of system and application performance, it is all a bit antiseptic. That is, we 
really haven't done anything to show how well a particular application tracks a 
satellite in the real world. Just as it is important to understand the relative 
performance factors of various systems, it is often critical to show that the 
system and application software work together to produce the desired result.</p>

<p><b>Real-World Data</b></p>

<p>Before we can set up any real-world benchmarks, there are several things that 
must be done. First, we must understand what type(s) of data are representative 
of our application under normal operating conditions. For example, if we need to 
point an antenna at a satellite for communication, to collect telemetry, or for 
radar tracking, then we will want to use look angles (azimuth and elevation) to 
test our application's performance. If we need to point a telescope at a 
satellite to perform optical tracking, then we would probably want to use right 
ascension and declination so that the satellite's position could be measured 
directly against a star background.</p>

<p>The second step in the process is to obtain a good quality data set to test 
the application against. The better the quality of the data set, the more useful 
it will be for this type of benchmarking. Because any data set is merely a set 
of observations&mdash;and any such set comes complete with its own 
errors&mdash;it is important that not only the raw data be available, but that 
there also be some discussion of the observation parameters and the error 
characteristics.</p>

<p>Good quality data sets can be difficult to come by, but if you know where to 
look, they can be found. For example, several satellite programs provide 
high-precision ephemerides (or more simply, tables of position and velocity over 
time). Satellite navigation programs, such as the Global Positioning System 
(GPS), or geodetic satellite programs, such as the LAGEOS or TOPEX/poseidon 
missions, provide very-high-precision ephemerides which can be used to test a 
wide range of applications and can even be used to test performance between 
competing high-precision orbital models. Testing high-precision models, of 
course, requires complete understanding (and modeling) of the specifics of the 
coordinate systems involved. About the only real drawback to these types of data 
sets is that they are available for only a limited set of orbit types.</p>

<p>The final requirement to be able to conduct real-world benchmarking of an 
application is to be able to output data from the application in a format 
suitable for comparison with the real-world data sets. Many satellite tracking 
applications have the ability to output ephemerides for use in analysis, but 
many do not describe the particulars of the coordinate system being used. For 
those applications that are entirely graphically based, testing anything more 
than a few data points can be extremely frustrating and time consuming.</p>

<p><b>A Real-World Case Study</b></p>

<p>Let's examine an actual case study to see what kind of information is 
required and how such a benchmark might be applied. As an example, let's look at 
some visual observing data for two satellites&mdash;Landsat 5 and Cosmos 
1766&mdash;and see how it was used to perform part of the validation effort for 
the routines that went into my SGP4 Pascal libraries that are used in the 
TrakStar program.</p>

<p>In the early 1990s, I was approached by the US Navy to help them test the 
operation of a new S-band antenna that was being built for them. Because of the 
narrow beamwidth of the antenna, it was important that the antenna be able to 
track within one-quarter degree of the intended target. Although the antenna was 
being built to support their FLTSATCOM satellites&mdash;which are geostationary 
and require little, if any, tracking&mdash;they wisely chose to test the system 
performance using a low-earth orbiting satellite (DMSP). The US Navy needed a 
satellite tracking program which would provide look angles to get the new 
antenna within the required tolerance.</p>

<p>As the code was developed and <i>verified</i> (<i>verification</i> is the 
process of ensuring that the program does what it is expected to do), it was 
obvious that the US Navy would not accept the program unless it could be 
<i>validated</i> (<i>validation</i> is the process of ensuring that the program 
accurately models the real world). That meant I needed to show that the program 
would work tracking representative low-earth orbiting satellites within the 
tolerances the US Navy required. I turned to a set of data I had obtained while 
working on another project with Contraves Goerz Corporation back in 1987 
(Contraves is best known for building the optics and mounts for US Space 
Command's GEODSS deep-space surveillance network, a system capable of resolving 
a basketball-sized target at a range of 20,000 miles).</p>

<p>The data was obtained during the process of satellite tracking using an 
optical instrument called a KINETO (KineTheodolite). The KINETO instruments are 
used by test ranges from the Far East to White Sands, NM. This particular 
instrument mounts a pair of lenses, a Zoom lens of instrumentation accuracy 
(180-1800 mm), and a 100-inch catadioptric lens of Contraves design, with better 
than 150 line pairs resolution for 75mm film. The instrument is remotely 
controlled by a set of 11/73 series DEC mini-computers (remember, this was built 
in the mid-1980s), and uses a hybrid, 8 MHz, real-time video tracking unit 
developed for a military anti-aircraft unit. The electronics are all mounted in 
an air-conditioned van, and the whole setup is mobile. With this instrument, you 
can drive down the road, park, set up in about an hour, and track a target. 
After the track, you can reduce the data, and obtain output on the target's look 
angles or position in ECI coordinates&mdash;again in less than an hour.</p>

<p>The data was collected in an auto-tracking mode with samples taken every 0.02 
seconds. The azimuth and elevation data is accurate to within 5 arc seconds 
(approximately 0.001 degrees), after having been corrected by a star calibration 
run. The observation point is known to approximately 1 cm, having been surveyed 
by GPS, Phase II, and by a USGS benchmark some 1 mile from the site. The details 
are presented in table 1.</p>

<p>An azimuth of zero degrees is true north and an elevation of zero degrees 
corresponds to the true earth tangent (WGS 72). The targets were tracked with a 
0.258-degree field of view optic using a video camera and a digitizing TV

<p>The observations were collected as a set of UTC times with corresponding 
(corrected) azimuth and elevation. To complete the data collection, it was 
necessary to obtain NORAD two-line element sets just prior to the observation 
periods. Both the original observation data and the NORAD two-line element sets 
are available on the CelesTrak WWW 
(<a href="http://celestrak.org">http://celestrak.org</a>).
The results of the 
observations are plotted against the predictions from 
<a href="/software/satellite/trakstar26a.zip">TrakStar's</a> look angle output 
in figures 1 and 2.</p>

<p class=center><img class=auto alt="Figure 1" src="fig-1.gif" width=703 height=402></p>

<p class=center><b>Figure 1. Landsat 5 Look Angles</b></p>

<p>In figure 1, the observations for Landsat 5 are plotted at five-second 
intervals along with the predictions from two successive NORAD two-line element 
sets&mdash;one with an epoch almost two days prior to the observations and the 
other with an epoch three hours afterwards. Landsat 5 is moving toward the 
horizon during the period of observation.</p>

<p class=center><img class=auto alt="Figure 2" src="fig-2.gif" width=719 height=404></p>

<p class=center><b>Figure 2. Cosmos 1766 Look Angles</b></p>

<p>In figure 2, the observations for Cosmos 1766 are plotted at five-second 
intervals along with the predictions from two successive NORAD two-line element 
sets&mdash;one with an epoch almost two days prior to the observations and the 
other with an epoch about an hour and a half afterwards. Cosmos 1766 is moving 
toward the horizon during the period of observation.</p>

<p>Examination of figures 1 and 2 shows very good agreement between the 
observations and the values predicted by TrakStar using either two-line element 
set. In fact, the agreement is so good that it is difficult to distinguish any 
difference on this scale. This is true even at the lower elevations where 
atmospheric refraction becomes significant because TrakStar calculates this 
effect (using standard atmosphere) when determining the look angles. In order to 
accentuate the differences between the observations and the predictions, the 
error (that is, the observed value minus the predicted value) is plotted for 
each element set in figures 3 and 4.</p>

<p class=center><img class=auto alt="Figure 3" src="fig-3.gif" width=701 height=414></p>

<p class=center><b>Figure 3. Landsat 5 Errors (Observed Minus Predicted)</b></p>

<p>In figure 3, the error trend for Landsat 5 moves from the upper right to the 
lower left (toward the origin) over the course of the observation period. While 
there does appear to be some systematic trend in the error, it is quite clear 
from this graph that the error remains well within the quarter-degree 
tolerance.</p>

<p class=center><img class=auto alt="Figure 4" src="fig-4.gif" width=715 height=408></p>

<p class=center><b>Figure 4. Cosmos 1766 Errors (Observed Minus Predicted)</b></p>

<p>In figure 4, the error trend for Cosmos 1766 moves from the lower left to the 
upper right (toward the origin) over the course of the observation period. 
Again, while there does appear to be some systematic trend(s) in the error, it 
is evident that the error remains well within the quarter-degree tolerance 
required by the US Navy. It was just this kind of analysis, using other test 
cases, that convinced the Navy that the NORAD SGP4 orbital model, together with 
the NORAD two-line element sets, was capable of generating look angles of 
sufficient accuracy to allow them to acquire low-earth orbiting satellites using 
their new S-band antenna.</p>

<p><b>Other Test Cases</b></p>

<p>There are many ways to devise useful benchmarks. We have already discussed 
using state vectors from satellite navigation programs such as GPS or various 
geodetic satellites to test model accuracy and demonstrated how visual 
observations can be used in our case study. Other approaches could include 
auto-tracking using a radio signal (many S-band antenna systems can do this), 
using Doppler shifts, or even timing AOS and LOS (acquisition of signal and loss 
of signal). These methods may not be as accurate as the others discussed, but 
could provide adequate validation for certain types of applications. In a future 
column, we will show how visual imagery can be used for validation, using a case 
study analyzing APT (automatic picture transmission) data from the NOAA 
polar-orbiting weather satellites.</p>

<p><b>A Proposal</b></p>

<p>While it is important for any user to understand the limitations of the 
application they are using for satellite tracking, it can be difficult and time 
consuming to build an appropriate test suite and conduct the benchmarks for that 
application themselves. A much more reasonable approach would be for the 
producer of the application to provide&mdash;as part of the application's 
documentation&mdash;an analysis of the application's performance against its 
intended purpose.</p>

<p>To ensure that such an analysis fairly represents a particular application's 
performance and that the results are directly comparable to those from other 
similar applications, it is paramount that such an analysis be conducted against 
a standardized test suite. Such a test suite could be developed by a technical 
committee of one of the professional societies of the astrodynamics community, 
such as the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) or the 
American Astronautical Society (AAS). Once a draft test suite was developed, it 
would be made available for community comments&mdash;with those comments being 
incorporated into the final version, as appropriate.</p>

<p>The test suite would consist of a number of dated data sets, together with 
relevant details on observation conditions, coordinate systems, and how the test 
should be applied. The test suite should be easily accessible via the Internet. 
This type of standard is long overdue in our community and would be a welcome 
addition not only in comparing satellite tracking packages but in improving 
their overall performance.</p>

From time to time, I'll get a question asking for two-line element sets for 
the moon (or the sun). This would seem to be a natural enough question. After 
all, the moon is a satellite of the earth and its orbit is described by the same 
basic parameters as those contained in the two-line element sets.</p>

<p>The rub here is that the two-line element sets you find on the Celestial WWW 
are not generic element sets&mdash;they are specific to NORAD's SGP4 orbital 
model. In order to understand why this distinction is important, I'd like to 
begin by briefly reviewing the basics of orbital modeling and specifically 
address the assumptions made in the SGP4 orbital model. Once we've done that, it 
should become clear why this model can't be used for tracking the moon. Then, 
we'll move on to cover some simple ways to track both the sun and the moon and 
discuss an interesting new application.</p>

<p>While we have covered some of this material before, it is important to note 
it here to place the larger question in perspective. First and foremost, we must 
understand what a model is to fully appreciate the general limitations of any 
orbital model and the specific limitations of the SGP4 orbital model. According 
to Shannon, "a model is a representation of an object, system, or idea in some 
form other than that of the entity itself."<a href="#NOTE1"><small><sup>1</sup></small></a></p>

<p>Models can come in many forms from physical and scale models to mathematical 
and computer models. Regardless of the form, models serve one of two purposes: 
they are either <i>descriptive</i> (explain the system of interest) or 
<i>prescriptive</i> (predict the behavior of the system).<a href="#NOTE2"><small><sup>2</sup></small></a>
The orbital models we use for predicting the position of an earth satellite 
(natural or artificial) fall in the latter category.</p>

<p>The reason for using a model, as Rosenblueth and Wiener note is that,</p>

<blockquote>
  No substantial part of the universe is so simple that it can be grasped and controlled
  without abstraction. Abstraction consists in replacing the part of the universe under
  consideration by a model of similar but simpler structure.<a href="#NOTE3"><small><sup>3</sup></small></a>
</blockquote>

<p>This statement is certainly true of orbital mechanics. While the underlying 
principles of gravitational attraction are pretty simple, extending them to 
objects other than point masses can become complicated pretty quickly.</p>

<p>When developing a model, it is important to do several things. First, you 
should understand the <i>goal</i> of developing the model. For the SGP4 orbital 
model, the goal was to track large numbers of artificial satellites orbiting the 
earth on a routine basis&mdash;the implication here being that the tracking 
needed to be computationally efficient to support daily operations. Of course, 
the speed of computation would have to be traded off against the accuracy (or 
fidelity) of the predictions, with some minimum level of performance.</p>

<p>The second thing that needs to be done is to define the <i>system</i> under 
investigation. Shannon defines a system as "a group or set of objects united by 
some form of regular interaction or interdependence,"<a href="#NOTE4"><small><sup>4</sup></small></a> 
which for our case amounts to our satellites and anything which influences their 
orbits. The range of influences would naturally include the gravitational 
influence of the earth, moon, sun, and planets, as well as things like 
atmospheric drag and solar pressure.</p>

<p>We must define the system as part of the process of balancing the goals of 
computational speed against predictive accuracy. If we could model every 
influence on the motion of a satellite, our accuracy be very good, but our 
computational speed would be low. If, however, we rank these effects by the 
magnitude of their influence, we find that some have no practical effect on the 
motion of a near-earth satellite. For example, the effect of the earth's gravity 
is much greater than that of Mars and, in fact, the gravitational pull of Mars 
has no practical influence on the orbits of these satellites. As such, there is 
no point in developing a model (and increasing the computational complexity) 
that includes such an effect.</p>

<p>When the predecessor to SGP4 (SGP or Simplified General Perturbation) was 
developed, most artificial satellites were in low-earth, circular orbits where 
the primary effects were the earth's gravity (including some of the major 
perturbations due to its non-spherical shape and non-uniform density) and 
atmospheric drag. Things such as solar and lunar gravitational effects and solar 
pressure had a negligible effect on these orbits. As a result, the model was 
developed incorporating only these effects. In addition, simplifications could 
be made since the mass of these artificial satellites is much much less than the 
mass of the earth and the effect of third bodies could be ignored.</p>

<p>To eliminate the need to numerically integrate the position of each satellite 
(a particularly time consuming computational process), an analytical model was 
developed that allowed the position to be calculated directly at the time of 
interest (for more information on numerical integration versus analytical 
models, see this column in the <a href="/columns/v01n04/">March/April 1995</a> 
issue of <i>Satellite Times</i>). This analytical model required a series 
expansion in terms of the orbit's eccentricity&mdash;a term that is usually 
small for the class of orbits being examined.</p>

<p>Both the reduction in the number of effects influencing the orbit of the 
satellite and the conversion from a numerical integrator to an analytical model 
served to considerably reduce the computational load of predicting the position 
of a given satellite. At the same time, however, it also reduced the accuracy of 
these predictions and placed some assumptions on the orbital characteristics 
being modeled to ensure the accuracy is maintained within reasonable limits.</p>

<p>These assumptions include the satellite having a negligible mass compared to 
that of the earth, with no third-body gravitational effects, and having a near-earth 
orbit&mdash;where the effects of the earth's gravity and atmospheric drag 
dominate&mdash;with a small eccentricity. With the exception of the low 
eccentricity, neither the orbit of the moon or the earth around the sun (to 
calculate the position of the sun) meet the remaining modeling assumptions. 
Since the orbital elements in the two-line element sets are generated by fitting 
observations to the SGP4 orbital model, trying to fit elements to orbits which 
do not satisfy our modeling assumptions will result in predictions which are 
likely to have large errors.</p>

<p>As can be seen from this development, therefore, there can be no two-line 
element sets for the position of the moon or the sun (actually, the earth's 
orbit around the sun). Equally important, it can be seen that predictions for 
orbits which have high values of eccentricity will likely be less accurate than 
those with small eccentricity.</p>

<p>Of course, as satellites began to be launched into higher orbits, other 
limitations in the SGP model's assumptions became apparent. In particular, above 
a certain altitude, effects such as solar-lunar gravity, solar pressure, and 
gravitational resonances with the spin of the earth dominate over that of 
atmospheric drag. As a result, SGP was modified to become SGP4 (or really, SGP4 
and SDP4). SGP4 is valid for <i>near-earth</i> orbits with periods of 225 
minutes (an altitude of roughly 5,000 km) or less while SDP4 is valid for 
<i>deep-space</i> orbits above that (well, at least out to geosynchronous 
altitude).</p>

<p>As would be expected, several tradeoffs had to be made in developing the SDP4 
portion of the model. Of course, some additional effects are included in this 
new model while atmospheric drag is eliminated, increasing the overall 
computational load. In addition, since the series expansion in eccentricity 
modeled only the earth's gravitational effect, some numerical integration was 
required to handle some of these new effects. The result is what is referred to 
as a semi-analytical model&mdash;again increasing the computational load. 
However, without these changes, the accuracy of predictions for orbits above the 
225-minute cutoff would be significantly reduced.</p>

<p><b>Down to Business</b></p>

<p>Just as a separate model is required to handle deep-space orbits, separate 
models are needed to predict the position of the sun or the moon with reasonable 
accuracy. Astronomers have expended considerable effort in developing models to 
predict the position of these bodies with extremely high accuracy for use in 
calculating circumstances for solar eclipses. In fact, at the beginning of this 
century, E.W. Brown spent twenty years developing his theory of the motion of 
the moon&mdash;ten years to develop the equations and another ten years to check 
them!</p>

<p>In the case of the sun's motion, not only must theory account for the earth-
moon orbit about the sun but also the rotation rate of the earth and the 
nutation and precession of the earth's axis. The moon's orbit is influenced by 
the gravitational attraction of not only the earth and the sun but also of the 
planets, together with interactions with the earth's ocean tides. High accuracy 
predictions require equations with hundreds of terms to account for the various 
effects.</p>

<p>For more practical applications of predicting the position of the sun and the moon for
calculating satellite eclipse circumstances or the rise and set times of these celestial
bodies, an excellent source is Jean Meeus's 
<a target="_BLANK" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0943396352/8457-7991521-393883"><i>Astronomical
Algorithms</i></a>. As the title suggests, this book covers a wide range of algorithms
relating to astronomical circumstances&mdash;including how to calculate the position of the
sun (chapters 24 and 25) and the moon (chapter 45).</p>

<p>For the sun, Meeus's algorithm&mdash;similar to the one in my <a 
href="/software/satellite/sgp4-plb26a.zip">SGP4 Pascal library</a>&mdash;predicts 
the sun's position to 0.01 degrees (two percent of the solar diameter) by 
assuming a purely elliptical motion for the earth and ignoring perturbations 
from the moon and planets. Each calculation only requires evaluation of eleven 
low-order polynomial equations with a dozen trigonometric evaluations. As seen 
in this column in the <a href="/columns/v03n01/">September/October 1996</a> 
issue of <i>Satellite Times</i>, this makes it possible to calculate when earth 
satellites are visible to observers on the ground by calculating the elevation 
of the sun and the position of the earth's shadow.<a href="#NOTE5"><small><sup>5</sup></small></a></p>

<p>Meeus's algorithm for the calculation of the position of the moon is 
considerably more complicated. The calculation is based on a summation of sine 
and cosine terms which, while significantly reduced from the hundreds of terms 
necessary for high accuracy computations, still requires ninety trigonometric 
evaluations. Using only these more significant terms, however, the algorithm is 
still able to provide accuracy of approximately 10 arcseconds in geocentric 
longitude and 4 arcseconds in geocentric latitude.<a 
href="#NOTE6"><small><sup>6</sup></small></a></p>

<p><b>An Interesting New Application</b></p>

<p>Back in August of this year, I received an e-mail message from Gary Eldridge 
wanting to know how to predict the position of the moon. Seems Gary has become 
hooked on watching satellites transit (cross the surface of) the moon's disk 
through his telescope. After relating his initial experiences, I can see 
why:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Got a GREAT silhouette view of Mir last Saturday night and some other 
  unknown satellite a few weeks prior. The detail was incredible while using an 
  8 inch reflector scope and 17mm eyepiece.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, the real problem here is figuring out just when a satellite is 
going to transit the moon (or the sun) so as to know when to look. Up to now, 
he's been using something of a brute force approach&mdash;running a large 
catalog of objects against a star background and examining in detail those that 
come close to the sun or moon.</p>

<p>I think this problem would make an interesting project for an upcoming 
column(s) since it has several intriguing aspects. First, it will be necessary 
to develop code to predict the position of the moon (to go along with that for 
the sun) which can be used with the SGP4 orbital model. Then, it will be 
necessary to define the circumstances of a successful transit: (1) the sun or 
moon above the observer's horizon, (2) for lunar transits, a minimum phase for 
the moon and the sun being a certain distance below the horizon, and (3) the 
satellite crossing the illuminated portion of the object's surface.</p>

<p>The challenging part of this project will be to come up with efficient ways 
to reduce the number of cases examined. The intriguing part is two-fold. First, 
since the satellite will transit the sun or the moon's disk, it is trivial to 
know exactly where to point a telescope (and track) to watch the transit and the 
background should be bright enough to make it easy to photograph or videotape 
the event. Second, it will be interesting to see just how much detail can be 
discerned of the satellite as it transits since, according to Gary, there seems 
to be some disagreement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I seem to have caused some controversy among other astronomers as to 
  whether a amateur telescope can resolve such detail on an orbital satellite. I 
  would not have thought so either until I started seeing these things. It seems 
  that when they cross in front of the Moon, the silhouette image reveals 
  incredible detail. Solar panels and other structures can easily be seen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, observation and timing of these transits will also serve to 
visually demonstrate the overall accuracy of the orbital model, as discussed in 
our last column on <a href="/columns/v03n02/">"Real-World Benchmarking."</a></p>

<p>I hope you will join me on this journey. Not only will we be covering new 
ground, but the development of an efficient tool to predict satellite transits 
is likely to spark a new aspect of visual observing. And I, for one, am looking 
forward to seeing your best photographs so we can share them with the world.</p>

<p>Up until now, our investigations in this column have centered on making 
predictions about the coordinates&mdash;for example, the azimuth and 
elevation&mdash;of a satellite at a specific time of interest. While the process 
of making these calculations accurately and efficiently is not a trivial matter, 
it only addresses one facet of orbital analysis.</p>

<p>One of the biggest questions typically faced by an orbital analyst is the 
question of when (or even if) some particular event will happen. There are many 
such instances which might be of interest: the rise or set of a satellite, the 
time of an equator crossing, the time of culmination (the highest elevation 
during a satellite pass), the entry and exit times for an eclipse, or the time 
of closest approach to another satellite.</p>

<p>As such, two of the most important tools available to an orbital analyst are 
tools for efficiently determining the roots and extrema (the minima and maxima) 
of equations. Finding roots corresponds to finding crossing phenomena, such as 
rise or set times, while finding extrema corresponds to finding optimal 
circumstances, such as the closest approach of a satellite. This column will be 
devoted to selecting the best method for each tool and to developing an 
understanding for how to apply them&mdash;skills which will be absolutely 
essential in some of our upcoming investigations.</p>

<p><b>The Problem</b></p>

<p>For the sake of this column, let's assume our task is to find the rise times 
of the satellite <i>NOAA 14</i> on 19 January 1997 for an observer located in 
Montgomery, Alabama. This type of task is a typical requirement of any ground 
station wishing to download weather imagery during an overhead pass of any one 
of a number of polar-orbiting weather satellites. Of course, the computer used 
at most weather ground stations performs many tasks&mdash;often including 
capturing the imagery&mdash;and tracks more than a single weather satellite, so 
we'd like to develop an algorithm that is as efficient as possible.</p>

<p><b>A Simple Approach</b></p>

<p>Perhaps the simplest way to approach such a problem is to generate an 
ephemeris (or table) of look angles for <i>NOAA 14</i> for the period of 
interest. We could then read through the ephemeris to determine when the 
satellite's elevation went from negative to positive to find the rise time. A 
graph of this ephemeris is shown in figure 1.</p>

<p class=center><img class=auto alt="Figure 1" src="fig-1.gif" width=647 height=442></p>

<p class=center><b>Figure 1. NOAA 14 Elevation Over Time</b></p>

<p>The first problem that presents itself is just what size time step we should 
use for our ephemeris. Make it too large and we may completely miss a pass. Make 
it too small and we'll spend the majority of our time calculating ephemeris 
values which we won't even use. For example, if we use an interval of one 
minute, we'll calculate 1,440 satellite positions just to find six rise times. 
And, to double our accuracy requires doubling our computations.</p>

<p><b>An Improved Solution</b></p>

<p>A more effective way to find our rise times would be to start with large 
steps and then reduce our step size as we get close to a solution. The 
<i>bisection method</i> uses just such an approach. However, before we can apply 
the bisection method, we must know that the interval we want to search contains 
a root.</p>

<p>Mathematically, a root exists in the interval (<i>a</i>,<i>b</i>) if 
<i>f</i>(<i>a</i>) and <i>f</i>(<i>b</i>) (where the function <i>f</i> 
represents the satellite's elevation) have opposite signs. This conclusion, of 
course, depends upon the function <i>f</i> being continuous over the interval 
(<i>a</i>,<i>b</i>). Since <i>NOAA&nbsp;14</i> (or any other existing satellite) 
does not have the ability to warp space, any function of its position will be 
continuous.</p>

<p>Before we tackle the issue of how to select the proper interval, let's do a 
quick comparison of the efficiency gain which results from using this approach. 
For an interval of one day, it could take as many as 1,440 evaluations to find 
our rise time to an accuracy of one minute. If we use the bisection method, 
however, we would start with an interval of 1,440 minutes and then halve it, 
repeating the process with the smaller interval that now contains our rise time. 
To achieve an accuracy of one minute would require only <i>eleven</i> 
calculations&mdash;an improvement of two orders of magnitude! And, doubling our 
accuracy now only requires one additional calculation rather than another 1,440! 
This property is known as <i>linear convergence</i>.</p>

<p>The bisection method has several advantages: speed and the guarantee of 
convergence (i.e., if the interval contains a root, it will find it). To apply 
it, however, we must determine the proper interval for our search.</p>

<p><b>Bracketing the Target</b></p>

<p>While we now have a much more efficient means to home in on our prey, we have 
actually just traded one problem for another. Instead of searching the entire 
time period of interest, we must first find a time period where one end of the 
interval corresponds to an elevation above the horizon and the other to one 
below the horizon. An examination of figure 1 shows this to be nearly as 
difficult as our original problem. And, if we're not careful, we can select an 
interval which has more than one rise time&mdash;the bisection method is only 
guaranteed to find one of them.</p>

<p>We can be much more effective in the hunt for our prey, however, if we first 
understand something about its characteristics. In developing an algorithm such 
as the one we're working on, it helps to first visualize our quarry, as we've 
done in figure 1. As with any satellite orbit (with the possible exception of a 
perfectly geostationary orbit), the first thing we notice is that our function 
is periodic. This result is completely expected since both the satellite's orbit 
and the earth's rotation are periodic. In fact, closer examination of figure 1 
shows there are actually two periods&mdash;one which corresponds to the 
satellite's orbit and the other to when the observer rotates under the orbital 
plane (which happens roughly twice a day).</p>

<p>Since we know that a root is bracketed by a minimum on one side and a maximum 
on the other, let's turn our attention to first developing a tool to find 
extrema. As it turns out, the approach is similar but subtly different. In 
searching for a root, splitting the interval in half turns out to be the optimal 
approach since only two points are needed to determine whether an interval 
contains a root. To find a minimum, however, requires three points.</p>

<p>To bracket a minimum over the interval (<i>a</i>,<i>b</i>), there must be a 
point <i>c</i> such that <i>f</i>(<i>c</i>) is less than <i>f</i>(<i>a</i>) and 
<i>f</i>(<i>b</i>) and <i>c</i> is our best guess at the minimum (see figure 2). 
To continue our search, we choose a point <i>x</i>, either in the interval 
(<i>a</i>,<i>c</i>) or (<i>c</i>,<i>b</i>). Let's say we choose the first 
interval. If <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) &lt; <i>f</i>(<i>c</i>), then the minimum is in 
the interval (<i>a</i>,<i>c</i>) and <i>x</i> is our new best minimum value (see 
the left side of figure 2); otherwise, the minimum is in the interval 
(<i>x</i>,<i>b</i>) and <i>c</i> is still our best minimum value (see the right 
side of figure 2). It turns out that the most efficient means of searching for 
the minimum (without considering the shape of our function) is to use the 
<i>golden section search</i>.</p>

<p class=center><img class=auto alt="Figure 2" src="fig-2.gif" width=647 height=441></p>

<p class=center><b>Figure 2. Bracketing a Minimum</b></p>

<p>It can be shown that the optimal choice for a new point within our bracketing 
interval is at approximately 38 percent (or 62 percent) of the interval. The 
name <i>golden section</i> or <i>golden mean</i> comes from the ancient Greeks 
who discovered this ratio. Using the golden section search will guarantee 
convergence and, like the bisection method, also converges linearly.</p>

<p><b>Tying It All Together</b></p>

<p>At first inspection, it would seem we've simply traded one problem for 
another. However, another look at figure 1 reveals that bracketing an extremum 
(minimum or maximum) should be much easier than bracketing a root. Each orbit of 
our target satellite produces a minimum and a maximum but does not necessarily 
produce a root. We make use of this information in the following approach.</p>

<p>To find the first pass of <i>NOAA 14</i> on 19 January 1997, let's examine 
the interval one orbital period <i>before</i> the beginning of the day 
(actually, we'll use slightly more than the orbital period since the interval 
between minima varies). The characteristics of our function assure us that there 
is at least one minimum in this interval. Finding the initial midpoint guess can 
be done using the golden section method&mdash;if the value at our new point is 
less than at the two endpoints, we search for a minimum; if it's greater, we 
search for a maximum; otherwise, we pick the other golden section value.</p>

<p>Once we know where a minimum is, we can find the next maximum by searching 
the interval from our minimum forward one orbital period. The same is true when 
finding a maximum&mdash;searching forward one orbital period brackets the next 
minimum. We can continue this process forward to find each successive minimum 
and maximum, finding them all very quickly. Each time we find a maximum, we 
would determine whether it is positive and for a minimum, whether it is 
negative. We would then only search for a root when one was properly bracketed. 
This method takes maximum advantage of the characteristics of our function to 
find what we're looking for.</p>

<p><b>Making It More Efficient</b></p>

<p>One limitation of the bisection and golden section methods is that they both 
ignore the shape of the function under investigation. While they both guarantee 
convergence and converge linearly, there are methods which can produce 
superlinear convergence by taking the derivative of the function into account. 
One such method which you may be aware of is the <i>Newton-Raphson method</i>. 
Unfortunately, this method only works when you can analytically determine the 
derivative of the function.</p>

<p>There are, however, adaptations of searches for roots and 
extrema&mdash;referred to as <i>Brent's methods</i>&mdash;which can provide 
superlinear convergence without the need for a derivative for well-behaved 
functions (such as the one we're working with). Our basic search strategy is the 
same except that the bisection and golden search methods are replaced by the 
more efficient Brent's methods. A detailed discussion of these 
methods&mdash;together with source code&mdash;can be found in chapters 9 and 10 of 
<a target="_BLANK" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0521431085/8457-7991521-393883"><i>Numerical 
Recipes in C: The Art of Scientific Computing</i></a> (Second Edition) by 
William H. Press, et al. I highly recommend this reference.</p>

<p>Whether we use these tools to generate pass schedules, as we have here, or in 
looking for satellite transits across the sun or the moon, the ability to 
quickly search for when a particular event occurs&mdash;or whether it even 
happens at all&mdash;will be a most useful skill. Once you've mastered their 
use, you'll wonder how you ever did without them!</p>

<p><i>[Note: This product is no longer available.  - TS]</i></p>

<p>One of the most common questions I get when talking to satellite tracking 
enthusiasts&mdash;both amateur and professional&mdash;is "what's the best 
satellite tracking software currently available?" Of course, there is no %best" 
package, because the features that make a particular software package great for 
one person won't satisfy another. That being said, some packages are better 
suited for certain tasks and without a review of the contenders, it's hard to 
know which ones those are.</p>

<p>That being said, I'd like to start of with a review of <i>Micro Orbiter 
3.0</i>. Of all the packages I've had a chance to look at, it is one of the few 
that will still run on a PC under <i>MS-DOS</i> and provides stunning graphics 
while doing so. It will also run in full-screen mode under newer operating 
systems such as <i>Windows 95</i>, but running in a standalone window requires 
some extensive configuration (instructions for which are not included in the 
documentation). Let's take a closer look at how <i>Micro Orbiter 3.0</i> stacks 
up.</p>

<p><b>Installation and Documentation</b></p>

<p><i>Micro Orbiter 3.0 Release 4.2</i>, written by Peter D. Armstrong of 
Precision Software Solutions, comes on three 3.5-inch diskettes together with an 
82-page users guide, a command summary/quick start and reference summary card, 
and a postage-paid registration card&mdash;it even comes with a pen to use for 
filling out the registration card! Precision Software Solutions has made every 
effort to make installation a snap. The installation instructions are very 
simple and the process itself is very straightforward. Overall, it took me less 
than five minutes to install the software and get the program up and running. 
And, the entire installation (including the optional US-only airport data) takes 
up just over 4 megabytes of disk space. The documentation is thorough, well 
organized, and easy to read.</p>

<p><b>Features</b></p>

<p>If you are serious about your satellite tracking, your first concern when 
evaluating a satellite tracking package is to determine what kind of orbital 
model is used. Since most of us rely on the NORAD two-line element sets as our 
data source, it is important that a satellite tracking program include the SGP4 
and SDP4 orbital models. <i>Micro Orbiter 3.0</i> incorporates not only SGP4 and 
SDP4 but also includes the older SGP and the newer (but never implemented) SGP8 
and SDP8.</p>

<p><i>Micro Orbiter 3.0</i> will allow for tracking of up to 20 satellites from 
a database of 65,535 satellites&mdash;more than enough, since NORAD only tracks 
about 7,500 today. Options for how to display these satellites abound, with no 
less than ten different projection modes: 

<ul>
  <li>Mercator (see figure 1)</li>
  <li>Orthographic (see figure 2)</li>
  <li>Armadillo</li>
  <li>Alber's Equal-Area</li>
  <li>Littrow</li>
  <li>Gnomonic</li>
  <li>Aitoff</li>
  <li>Lagrange</li>
  <li>Oblique Aspect</li>
  <li>Star Chart (see figure 3)</li>
</ul>

<p class=center><b>Figure 1. Mercator projection of NOAA weather satellites.</b></p>

<p>If anything, the wealth of projections is almost overwhelming. It quickly 
becomes apparent that projections were added to the program incrementally, since 
the hot-key combinations, mapping features, and modes of operation vary among 
the many projections. But even here, <i>Micro Orbiter 3.0</i> provides a 
solution by providing a pull-down menu which provides a much cleaner 
presentation of the options available&mdash;I only wish it had mouse support to 
make this type of access easier.</p>

<p class=center><img class=auto alt="Figure 2" src="fig-2.gif" width=640 height=480></p>

<p class=center><b>Figure 2. Orthographic projection of NOAA weather satellites.</b></p>

<p>The program has a clean, professional-looking interface and the graphics are 
both fast and superb, especially for <i>MS-DOS</i>. Most displays include: time 
(elapsed or local), range, range rate, doppler, latitude and longitude, and 
azimuth and elevation. These data can also be output to a text file for more 
precise analysis. And, context-sensitive help is available throughout the 
program&mdash;that is, when you hit F1, you get help tailored to the part of the 
program you are currently working with. The only problem I had with the 
interface was using the hot key combinations. Not all of the hot key sequences 
make sense (most likely the result of features being added over time) and the 
command summary card has the hot keys listed in alphabetical order rather than 
functionally grouped. The context-sensitive help is a great aid here and the 
pull-down menus do group things functionally.</p>

<p>Almost everything in <i>Micro Orbiter 3.0</i> is configurable to accommodate 
varied user tastes. Don't like the map colors? Change them. Want to show 
constellation names on your star chart? Go right ahead. The options for displays 
are well thought out, right down to allowing night-vision colors for the star 
chart (see figure 3).</p>

<p class=center><img class=auto alt="Figure 3" src="fig-3.gif" width=640 height=350></p>

<p class=center><b>Figure 3. Sky projection of <i>NOAA 14</i> satellite.</b></p>

<p><i>Micro Orbiter 3.0 </i>is best suited to real-time tracking. While, it does 
have features to do some rudimentary time control, such as advancing manually or 
automatically (in most modes) or jumping to a particular time, this control 
lacks flexibility. For example, there is no way to look at a satellite's 
position prior to the epoch of the element set being used&mdash;the program 
assumes such a projection would be invalid and provides no option to override 
it. These limitations can make analysis difficult.</p>

<p>In real-time tracking mode, however, <i>Micro Orbiter 3.0</i> excels. There 
are features to calculate upcoming passes&mdash;visible or otherwise&mdash;and 
event timers which count down to inform you of when an upcoming event (rise, 
set, peak elevation) will occur. In fact, the user can set <i>hundreds</i> of 
event timers. The user can even generate pass schedules for large numbers of 
satellites at once, although this output goes to a text file. Displays show the 
position of the sun and moon and will indicate when a satellite is illuminated, 
above the observer's horizon, and visible. For star backgrounds, <i>Micro 
Orbiter 3.0</i> uses the <i>Yale Bright Star Catalog</i> of over 9,000 stars 
(down to magnitude 8.2).</p>

<p>Last, but not least, is the ability to input orbital data. The layout here is 
not as clear as other parts of the program, but the context-sensitive help will 
guide you through. It is quite easy to update, append, merge, or replace 
elements in the master database using text files containing NORAD two-line 
element sets found on the Celestial WWW site and many other sources. The only 
apparent limitations are in the delete function which will only work with a 
single satellite at a time&mdash;making it difficult to clear out the file and 
start over, and the search function&mdash;which requires a case-sensitive exact 
match.</p>

<p>Selecting 20 satellites out of 65,535 to begin tracking might seem like a 
daunting task, but <i>Micro Orbiter 3.0</i> does provide a mechanism to track 
groups of satellites with a little pre-configuration. By defining a list of 
satellites in a text file and then creating an <i>MS-DOS</i> batch file to make 
this file the default tracking file, it is easy to start up tracking your 
favorite weather, amateur radio, or visible satellites.</p>

<p><b>Benchmarking</b></p>

<p>The bread and butter of any satellite tracking program lies in the accuracy 
of its predictions. All the fancy graphics in the world won't amount to much if 
the results can't be relied upon. In an earlier column on benchmarking (<a 
href="/columns/v03n02/">"Real-World Benchmarking,"</a> <i>Satellite Times</i>, 
Volume 3, Number 2), we demonstrated that the basic routines used in my <a 
href="/software/satellite/trakstar26a.zip"><i>TrakStar</i></a> program were able 
to predict satellite positions within about one-tenth of a 
degree&mdash;<i>TrakStar</i> has also been validated against test cases for SGP4 
and SDP4 provided by US Space Command.</p>

<p>As such, we can use the output from <i>TrakStar</i> and compare it to that of 
<i>Micro Orbiter 3.0</i> to give us an idea of how well the latter performs. I 
used NORAD Element Set 201 for <i>Mir</i> and generated ephemerides (tables of 
predictions) of ECI position and velocity and latitude, longitude, and altitude 
for the period 1200-1230 UTC on 1997 April 17; and azimuth, elevation, and range 
for the period 0157-0207 UTC on 1997 April 18 for a limited test case. The 
results are shown in table 1.</p>

<p>There was no difference at all in the SGP4 position and velocity predicted by 
<i>Micro Orbiter 3.0</i>, indicating a good implementation of the NORAD model. 
There was some small difference in the latitude and altitude (but not the 
longitude) of <i>Mir</i>, most likely due to a difference in the model of the 
earth's shape used by the two programs&mdash;<i>TrakStar</i> uses WGS 72; 
<i>Micro Orbiter 3.0</i> uses WGS 84. Finally, there was no difference in 
azimuth or range between the two programs, but there was a difference in 
elevation, which was inversely proportional to the elevation. This result is 
probably due to the fact that <i>TrakStar</i> models atmospheric refraction at 
standard temperature and pressure and <i>Micro Orbiter 3.0</i> does not. 
Overall, a very good performance by <i>Micro Orbiter 3.0.</i></p>

<p>It should be noted that by differences, I do not mean to imply that <i>Micro 
Orbiter 3.0</i> is in error&mdash;only that it uses different modeling 
assumptions than <i>TrakStar</i>. These differences are well within the error 
tolerance of the SGP4 orbital model (5 kilometers with 90 percent confidence) 
and should not be treated as significant.</p>

<p><b>Summary</b></p>

<p><i>Micro Orbiter 3.0</i> is a superb choice for real-time satellite 
tracking&mdash;especially if you are still using <i>MS-DOS</i>. Installation is 
a snap, taking less than five minutes to get it up and running. Orbital 
predictions are quick and accurate, based upon the NORAD orbital models, and an 
easy mechanism for importing two-line element sets is provided. The interface is 
professional and graphics are excellent, rivaling even some Windows-based 
packages. It features a wealth of map projections and options for configuring 
them which, although cumbersome to access via hot keys, are easy to access via 
pull-down menus. And, at a price of $49.95 (plus $4 shipping and handling), it 
is a hard deal to beat.</p>

<p>For most of us, our satellite-tracking interests extend to only a small 
handful of satellites. Whether it be the amateur radio or weather satellites, 
TVRO, or even the combined GPS/Glonass constellation, we're typically talking 
about tens of satellites. Even if we consider all of the operational satellites 
on orbit, we're still only talking about hundreds of satellites. But there are 
those among us whose duty it is to track the now 8,500 satellites in earth 
orbit&mdash;payloads, spent boosters, and other debris&mdash;on a daily basis. 
These are the men and women of the Space Control Center (SCC), buried deep 
within Cheyenne Mountain.</p>

<p class=center><img class=auto alt="Figure 1" src="fig-1.jpg" width=344 height=205></p>

<p class=center><b>Figure 1. Cheyenne Mountain Command Center</b></p>

<p>Part of the Cheyenne Mountain Operations Complex or CMOC, the SCC is 
responsible for detection, identification, and daily tracking of all man-made 
objects in space. Run by US Space Command for the North American Aerospace 
Defense Command (NORAD), it is manned primarily by personnel from the Air Force, 
Naval, and Army Space Commands and the Canadian Air Force. Their basic mission 
is to protect the North American continent and US and Canadian interests 
worldwide against threats from space.</p>

<p>These threats come from a variety of sources. They can arise from dangers 
such as overhead surveillance of military forces during conflict. Or, they can 
also result from accidental events, such as the reentry of a space 
object&mdash;which might threaten a population center or trigger a false 
missile-attack warning&mdash;or the collision of a dead satellite or a piece of 
debris with an operational satellite such as the US space shuttle. The only real 
way to guard against these threats is to detect any and all space objects, 
identify what they are (and what their missions are), and know where they are 
(or will be) at all times.</p>

<p><b>The Space Surveillance Network</b></p>

<p>To accomplish its mission, the SCC relies on the Space Surveillance Network 
or SSN as its eyes and ears. The SSN is a network of sensors located at two 
dozen sites worldwide and operated by US Army, Navy, and Air Force personnel. 
The SSN uses three primary types of sensors to monitor the earth's population of 
artificial satellites: conventional radars, phased-array radars, and an optical 
system known as the Ground-Based Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance system 
or GEODSS.</p>

<p class=center><img class=auto alt="Figure 2" src="fig-2.gif" width=640 height=393></p>

<p class=center><b>Figure 2. Space Surveillance Network Locations</b></p>

<p>The SSN's conventional radars consist of both tracking and immobile antennas. 
Typically, these antennas operate in bistatic mode&mdash;that is, one antenna 
transmits a pulse and another receives the return. One of the more interesting 
'conventional' radars in the SSN is the NAVSPASUR system&mdash;a network of 
three transmitting and six receiving radar sites spanning the continental US 
from San Diego, California to Tattnall, Georgia. Laid out as a fence of 
electromagnetic energy along the 32<sup>nd</sup>-33<sup>rd</sup> parallel 
through which all satellites with orbital inclinations greater than 33&deg; must 
pass twice a day (over 80 percent of the current population), it can detect 
objects crossing it out to a distance of more than 25,000 kilometers.</p>

<p>The SSN phased-array radars can track a dozen or more satellites 
simultaneously and scan large volumes of space because they have no moving 
mechanical parts. Instead, these radars are composed of thousands of small 
elements which can be phased to electronically steer the antenna. Of the SSN's 
phased-array radars, the AN/FPS-85 at Eglin AFB in Florida is the workhorse of 
the network. It is made up of almost 6,000 transmitter antennas and 20,000 
receiver antennas and can track objects from just above the horizon to just 
short of the zenith over an azimuth of 120 degrees. Capable of generating 30 
megawatts of radio frequency power, it can track space objects in excess of 
40,000 kilometers in range.</p>

<p class=center><img class=auto alt="Figure 3" src="fig-3.gif" width=500 height=367></p>

<p class=center><b>Figure 3. AN/FPS-85 Phased-Array Radar</b></p>

<p>Each GEODSS site combines three telescopes&mdash;two primary 40-inch 
telescopes and one 15-inch auxiliary&mdash;to image objects in space 10,000 
times dimmer than can be seen with the unaided human eye. Rather than using 
photographs, as the earlier Baker-Nunn cameras did, it uses charge-coupled 
devices (CCDs) to electronically image each satellite track. Computer processing 
then removes the stars and other background light sources to produce the 
observations. As with any optical system, GEODSS can only be operated at night 
and in clear weather.</p>

<p class=center><img class=auto alt="Figure 4" src="fig-4.jpg" width=400 height=250></p>

<p class=center><b>Figure 4. GEODSS Site</b></p>

<p>This network of dedicated and collateral sensors generates up to 80,000 
satellite observations each day and sends them back to the SCC via redundant 
communications systems. While this may seem to be a lot of observations, it 
still does not permit continual tracking of everything in earth 
orbit&mdash;primarily because of the limitations arising from the geographical 
distribution of the ground-based sensors. As a result, the SSN uses a predictive 
technique to monitor the catalog of space objects&mdash;periodically making sure 
each object is where it is predicted to be and generating new element sets when 
they aren't.</p>

<p><b>The Satellite Catalog</b></p>

<p>In order to be able to keep track of everything once it's detected, the 
1<sup>st</sup> Command and Control Squadron (1<sup>st</sup> CACS) maintains a 
catalog of all space objects orbiting the earth (and some beyond) which are ten 
centimeters (about the size of a baseball) or larger in size. Over the years, 
they have catalogued almost 25,000 objects. Of the 8,500 objects being tracked 
today, only about 7 percent are operational satellites, 15 percent are rocket 
bodies, and the remaining 78 percent are either inactive satellites or assorted 
other space debris.</p>

<p>Subtracting out the number of active satellites from the total population, it 
quickly becomes apparent that there are almost 8,000 uncontrolled objects of 
various sizes and shapes tumbling through space at velocities ranging from 3 to 
10 kilometers/second. Being hit by one of these could ruin your whole day. 
Keeping track of potential collisions&mdash;especially with manned spacecraft 
such as the US space shuttle or Mir space station&mdash;is an important part of 
the SCC mission.</p>

<p>According to US Space Command, most debris&mdash;about 84 
percent&mdash;orbits above 800 kilometers&mdash;an altitude more than twice that 
of either the US space shuttle or Mir space station. They assess the likelihood 
of a significant collision with one of these manned spacecraft as extremely 
remote&mdash;about one chance in 10,000 years. Space is&mdash;after all&mdash;a 
pretty big place. Unfortunately, the likelihood of a collision with something 
smaller than ten centimeters in size is higher and unknown since the SSN cannot 
currently track these objects.</p>

<p>Each item in the Satellite Catalog (SATCAT) is identified by two unique 
identifiers. The first is the International Designation. Prior to 1963, the 
International Designation was made up of two parts: (1) the launch of the year 
(the year itself being implicit) and (2) the piece of the launch. The launches 
of each year were designated (in order) by the letters of the Greek alphabet and 
the pieces of each launch were numbered.</p>

<p>This system was more than adequate in the 1950s since there were only a 
handful of launches each year. In 1961, however, the number of launches exceeded 
the number of letters in the Greek alphabet, so, launches after the 
24<sup>th</sup> launch of 1961 were preceded with the letter Alpha (which is 
abbreviated to A in the database, e.g., A ALPHA, A BETA). With even more 
launches in 1962, launches after the 48<sup>th</sup> were preceded with the 
letter Beta (e.g., B ALPHA, B BETA). It was quickly becoming apparent that a new 
system was required.</p>

<p>In 1963, the International Designation was changed to consist of three parts: 
(1) the year of the launch, (2) the launch of that year (000 through 999), and 
(3) the piece of that launch (A through ZZZ). For example, the Mir space station 
has the International Designation 1986-017A, that is, it was piece 'A' of the 
17<sup>th</sup> launch of 1986.</p>

<p>The second unique identifier is the NORAD Catalog Number. It is simply a 
number indicating the sequence in which space objects have been added to the 
SATCAT. The NORAD Catalog Number and International Designation do not always 
track together since it is possible to detect a piece of a launch well after the 
first piece of that launch was detected. The Mir space 
station&mdash;International Designation 1986-017A&mdash;is NORAD Catalog Number 
16609. However, the last garbage dump from Mir (yes, even these are catalogued) 
was International Designation 1986-017MA, NORAD Catalog Number 24673. The 
International Designation system considers any subsequent debris&mdash;no matter 
how many years later&mdash;to be part of the original launch.</p>

<p>Identifying satellites by name can be problematic. Because many satellites 
have multiple payloads onboard, it is common for the same platform to be 
referred to by different names. Several amateur radio satellites fall in this 
category because they are piggybacked on another payload, being referred to by 
the name of the amateur radio payload by the its user community and the name of 
the main payload by its user community. Other satellites simply have multiple 
names, as with the Cosmos series of satellites. It is always best to use one of 
the unique identifiers above when referring to a specific satellite to ensure 
there is no ambiguity.</p>

<p><b>An Online Satellite Catalog</b></p>

<p>Having access to the current SATCAT can be a useful tool for those involved 
with satellite tracking. Whether it is used to find something specific such as 
the NORAD Catalog Number for a satellite in order to obtain the proper element 
set or just to perform some statistical analyses (e.g., number of payloads on 
orbit, percent of the catalog launched by the US), the results can be both 
helpful and enlightening. If I had more space, I could regale you with various 
space trivia showing trends within the SATCAT. Perhaps I'll save that for 
another day.</p>

<p>Instead, I am working on providing an online version of the SATCAT on the 
Celestial WWW site. Based largely on NASA's <i>Satellite Situation Report</i> 
combined with information from 
<a href="http://www.planet4589.org/space/jsr/jsr.html"><i>Jonathan's 
Space Report</i></a> and the monthly NSSDC's 
<a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacewarn/"><i>SPACEWARN Bulletin</i></a>, 
it will provide a fully-searchable online catalog with weekly updates. It should 
be available online by the time this issue reaches you. The goal is to provide a 
current catalog along with various statistics and charts to make it easier for 
you to answer your questions about the population of earth-orbiting satellites. 
I hope you'll find it useful. As always, if you have any questions or comments 
regarding this column, please feel free to contact me at

<p>As I sat in my hotel room answering e-mail on a recent trip to Washington, 
DC, I realized that a column of this nature was probably long overdue. Most of 
the questions I receive are the result of the lack of publicly available 
documentation on the NORAD SGP4/SDP4 orbital model and the two-line orbital 
element sets, although a few deal with issues involved in the administration of 
the orbital data maintained on the Celestial WWW site. In this column, I hope to 
provide a single source of answers to what I've seen to be the top dozen or so 
questions on this topic. Here is a summary of the questions I'll answer in this 
and the next column:

  <li><a href="/columns/v04n05/index.php#FAQ13">Where does one find a list of satellite frequencies?</a></li>
</ol>

<p>I'll answer the first four questions in this column and the remainder in the 
next one.</p>

<p><a name="FAQ01"><i>What is the format for the two-line element sets?</i></a> 
A NORAD two-line element set consists of two 69-character lines of data which 
can be used together with NORAD's SGP4/SDP4 orbital model to determine the 
position and velocity of the associated satellite. The only valid characters in 
a two-line element set are the numbers 0-9, the capital letters A-Z, the period, 
the space, and the plus and minus signs&mdash;no other characters are valid.</p>

<p>Of course, not all valid characters can be used in all columns within the 
element set. Figure 1 shows what type of character is valid for each column. 
Columns with a space or period can have no other character. Columns with an 'N' 
can have any number 0-9 or, in some cases, a space. Columns with an 'A' can have 
any character A-Z or a space. The column with a 'C' can only have a character 
representing the classification of the element set&mdash;normally either a 'U' 
for unclassified data or an 'S' for secret data (of course, only unclassified 
data are publicly available). Columns with a '+' can have either a plus sign, a 
minus sign, or a space and columns with a '-' can have either a plus or minus 
sign (if the rest of the field is not blank).</p>

<br>
<p>Column 1 of each line of the two-line element set indicates the line number 
(and hence the format) for that line. The next field on each line (fields 1.2 
and 2.2) indicates the satellite number&mdash;actually, the NORAD Catalog 
Number&mdash;of the object the data is for. The NORAD Catalog Number is a unique 
identifier assigned by NORAD for each earth-orbiting artificial satellite in 
their SATCAT (Satellite Catalog). For a valid two-line element set, fields 1.2 
and 2.2 must be identical. As mentioned above, field 1.3 indicates the security 
classification of the data&mdash;all publicly available data will have a 'U' in 
this field to indicate unclassified data.</p>

<p>The next three fields&mdash;fields 1.4 through 1.6&mdash;define the 
International Designator of the object. This identifier is an additional unique 
designation assigned by the <i>World Data Center-A for Rockets and 
Satellites</i> (WDC-A-R&amp;S) in accordance with international treaty (1975 
Convention on Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space). The WDC-A-R&amp;S 
works together with NORAD and NASA's National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC) 
in maintaining this registry. Although there have been some changes in format 
since it was first used back in the late 1950s (see 
<a href="/columns/v04n01/">"Space Surveillance"</a> in <i>Satellite Times</i> 
Volume 4 Number 1), the International Designator indicates the year of the 
launch (field 1.4 only gives the last two digits), the launch of that year 
(field 1.5), and the piece of that launch (field 1.6) for each object. These 
three fields can be left blank, but all must be present if any is. Finally, 
field 1.6 can be either right or left justified&mdash;the latter is 
preferred.</p>

<p>As an aside, there are some significant differences between NORAD's Catalog 
Number and the International Designator. For example, NORAD assigns a catalog 
number based upon when the object was first observed, whereas the International 
Designator is always tied to the original launch. For example, the 
81<sup>st</sup> launch of 1968 carried four payloads into orbit: OV2-5, ERS 21 
and 28, and LES 6. Together with the Titan 3C transtage rocket body, these 
objects were assigned International Designators 1968-081A through E and Catalog 
Numbers 03428 through 03431. Just this past October, however, NORAD cataloged 
two additional pieces associated with this launch as Catalog Numbers 25000 and 
25001&mdash;they have the International Designators 1968-081F and G.</p>

<p>The next two fields (fields 1.7 and 1.8) together define the reference time 
for the element set and are jointly referred to as the epoch. Field 1.7 is the 
two-digit year (more on this later) and field 1.8 is the day of that year. The 
epoch defines the time to which all of the time-varying fields in the element 
set are referenced. </p>

<p>While talking about the epoch, this is perhaps a good place to answer the 
other time-related questions. <a name="FAQ02">First, <i>how is the epoch time 
format interpreted?</i></a> This question is best answered by using an example. 
An epoch of 98001.00000000 corresponds to 0000 UT on 1998 January 01&mdash;in 
other words, midnight between 1997 December 31 and 1998 January 01. An epoch of 
98000.00000000 would actually correspond to the beginning of 1997 December 
31&mdash;strange as that might seem. <a name="FAQ03">Note that the epoch day 
starts at UT midnight (not noon) and that all times are measured mean solar 
rather than sidereal time units (the answer to our third question).</a></p>

<p><a name="FAQ04"><i>How will the Year 2000 be handled?</i></a> Right now, 
probably <i>the</i> most common question I'm asked is how years beyond 1999 will 
be handled in the two-line element sets. Actually, the use of a two-digit year 
affects both fields 1.4 and 1.7, although the impact of the latter is definitely 
much more important. To date, I have been unable to secure an official response 
to this question from US Space Command. Informally, I have been told that there 
will be no change in the two-line element set format to accommodate the arrival 
of the Year 2000. However, while the format may not change, the interpretation 
of the format does.</p>

<p>Apparently, US Space Command sees no need to change the two-line element set 
format yet since no artificial earth satellites existed prior to 1957. By their 
reasoning, two-digit years from 57-99 correspond to 1957-1999 and those from 
00-56 correspond to 2000-2056. Therefore, there is no need to change the format for 
another 50 years! Unfortunately, this reasoning is severely flawed. While 
changing the format would involve changing large numbers of software packages to 
accommodate the format changes, not changing the format does not remove the need 
to modify this software. Instead of incorporating a format change along with the 
software modifications, modifications must be made now to change the epoch 
interpretation and later when the format is finally changed. Too bad that when 
Aerospace Defense Command proposed going from the old five-line to the current 
two-line format in November 1972 they didn't recommend a four-digit year (they 
did, however, at least change from a one-digit to a two-digit year).</p>

<p>Field 1.9 represents the first derivative of the mean motion divided by two, 
in units of revolutions per day<sup>2</sup>, and field 1.10 represents the 
second derivative of the mean motion divided by six, in units of revolutions per 
day<sup>3</sup>. Together, these two fields give a second-order picture of how 
the mean motion is changing with time. However, these two fields are not used by 
the SGP4/SDP4 orbital models (only by the simpler SGP model) and, therefore, 
serve no real purpose.</p>

<p>Field 1.11 represents something called <i>B*</i> (BSTAR), which is an 
SGP4-type drag coefficient. In aerodynamic theory, every object has a ballistic 
coefficient, <i>B</i>, that is the product of its coefficient of drag, 
<i>C<sub>D</sub></i>, and its cross-sectional area, <i>A</i>, divided by its 
mass, <i>m</i>.</p>

<p class=center><i>B = C<sub>D</sub> A/m</i></p>

<p>The ballistic coefficient represents how susceptible an object is to 
drag&mdash;the higher the number, the more susceptible. <i>B*</i> is an adjusted 
value of <i>B</i> using the reference value of atmospheric density, 
&rho;<sub>o</sub>.</p>

<p class=center><i>B* = B</i> &rho;<sub>o</sub>/2</p>

<p><i>B*</i> has units of (earth radii)<sup>-1</sup>.</p>

<p>Fields 1.10 and 1.11 have a somewhat different format that the other fields. 
In particular, they use a modified exponential notation with an implied leading 
decimal point. This convention is inherited from FORTRAN where all such numbers 
range from 0 to less than 1. The first six columns of each field represent the 
mantissa and the last two represent the exponent. For example, the value -12345-6
corresponds to -0.12345 &times; 10<sup>-6</sup>. Each of 
these two fields can be blank, corresponding to a value of zero.</p>

<p>Field 1.12 represents the ephemeris type (i.e., orbital model) used to 
generate the data. <i>Spacetrack Report Number 3</i> suggests the following 
assignments: 1=SGP, 2=SGP4, 3=SDP4, 4=SGP8, 5=SDP8. However, this value is used 
for internal analysis only&mdash;all distributed element sets have a value of 
zero and are generated using the SGP4/SDP4 orbital model (as appropriate).</p>

<p>Field 1.13 represents the element set number. Normally, this number is 
incremented each time a new element set is generated. In practice, however, this 
doesn't always happen. When operations switch between the primary and backup 
Space Control Centers, sometimes the element set numbers get out of sync, with 
some numbers being reused and others skipped. Unfortunately, this makes it 
difficult to tell if you have all the element sets for a particular object.</p>

<p>The last column on each line (fields 1.14 and 2.10) represents a modulo-10 
checksum of the data on that line. To calculate the checksum, simply add the 
values of all the numbers on each line&mdash;ignoring all letters, spaces, 
periods, and plus signs&mdash;and assigning a value of 1 to all minus signs. The 
checksum is the last digit of that sum. Although this is a very simple 
error-checking procedure, it should catch 90 percent of all errors. However, many 
errors can still sneak through. To eliminate these, all data posted on the 
CelesTrak site not only pass the checksum test, but must also pass both 
format and range-checking tests (as described in this article).</p>

<p>Line 2 consists primarily of mean elements calculated using the SGP4/SDP4 
orbital model. The definitions for fields 2.3 through 2.8 can be seen in table 2 
below. Fields 2.3, 2.4, 2.6, and 2.7 all have units of degrees and can range 
from 0 up to 360 degrees&mdash;field 2.3 (inclination) only goes up to 180 
degrees. The eccentricity (field 2.5) is a unitless value with an assumed 
leading decimal point. For example, a value of 1234567 corresponds to an 
eccentricity of 0.1234567. The mean motion (field 2.8) is measured in 
revolutions per day.</p>

<p>The final field on line 2, prior to the checksum, is the rev number. Since 
there are several conventions for determining rev numbers, this field also bears 
some clarification. In NORAD's convention, a revolution begins when the 
satellite is at the ascending node of its orbit and a revolution is the period 
between successive ascending nodes. The period from launch to the first 
ascending node is considered to be Rev 0 and Rev 1 begins when the first 
ascending node is reached. Since many element sets are generated with epochs 
that place the satellite near its ascending node, it is important to note 
whether the satellite has reached the ascending node when calculating subsequent 
rev numbers.</p>

<p>In general, any number smaller than the maximum field size can be padded with 
either leading spaces or leading zeros. In other words, an epoch can be 
represented as either 98001.12345678 or 98 1.12345678 or an inclination can be 
represented as 28.1234 or 028.1234. Convention uses leading zeros for fields 1.5 
and 1.8 and leading spaces elsewhere, but either is valid.</p>

<p>Obviously, there are a few limitations with the current two-line format. 
First and foremost is the need for a four-digit year in fields 1.4 and 1.7. 
Next, there is a need for a more robust form of error checking&mdash;perhaps a 
16-bit CRC. Such a checksum could be applied to both lines together, not only 
detecting errors within the data but also mismatched lines 1 and 2. If such 
changes were made, it might also be wise to increase the field size for the 
Catalog Number to six or seven digits to support the eventual cataloging of 
smaller debris.</p>

<p>The International Designator format seems to suffice for the foreseeable 
future, with a four-digit year, up to 999 launches (the most we've had to date 
in any one year was 129 in 1984), and up to 13,824 pieces (the record holder 
today is 1994-029 with 672 pieces). Of course, the cataloging of smaller 
debris&mdash;which we may be unable to correlate with the original 
launch&mdash;still presents potential problems.</p>

</ol>

<p><a name="FAQ05"><i>How does one convert two-line elements to some other 
format?</i></a> Actually, this is one of the most common questions I get asked. 
Usually, the user has data in some other format that they want to use in a 
program that uses two-line element sets or they have two-line element set data 
that they want to use in their favorite satellite-tracking program. The simple 
answer is: Just don't do it! Here's why.</p>

<p>The common misconception is that the two-line element sets are simply a 
format for standard data. After all, if both the two-line element set format and 
Format X have an eccentricity term, it should be a simple matter of substituting 
the value. Other terms could simply be interchanged by using a straightforward 
mathematical transformation (such as the relationship between mean motion and 
semi-major axis). Isn't there a program to automatically handle this conversion? 
Unfortunately, it's not quite that simple.</p>

<p>The elements in the two-line element sets are mean elements calculated to fit 
a set of observations using a specific model&mdash;the SGP4/SDP4 orbital model. 
Just as you shouldn't expect the arithmetic and geometric means of a set of data 
to have the same value, you shouldn't expect mean elements from different 
element sets&mdash;calculated using different orbital models&mdash;to have the 
same value. The short answer is that you cannot simply reformat the data unless 
you are willing to accept predictions with unpredictable errors. The long answer 
is that I will discuss a method for transforming element sets&mdash;which 
involves a much more complicated process&mdash;in a future column.</p>

<p><a name="FAQ06"><i>What is the accuracy of predictions using the two-line 
element sets?</i></a> Accuracy of the two-line element sets is dependent upon a 
number of factors. These range from the particular sensors used and amount of 
data collected to the type of orbit and condition of the space environment. 
Unfortunately, since these factors vary for each element set, so does the 
accuracy. While NORAD has experimented with methods to incorporate prediction 
quality into the element sets, none of these methods has yet proved 
successful.</p>

<p>It is possible, however, to assess the <i>consistency</i> of the element set 
data, rather than their accuracy. That is, how well one element set's 
predictions agree with those of its successor or predecessor element set. By 
comparing the magnitude of the vector difference of the predictions from two 
successive element sets at the epoch of the newer element set (when it should be 
most accurate), it is possible to gauge the consistency between those element 
sets. Taken in aggregate for a particular satellite over time, it is possible to 
gauge the general accuracy of the data (assuming that the element set production 
process is statistically unbiased) and get a sense for how long an element set 
is valid.</p>

<p>While NORAD maintains specific target tolerances for the overall level of 
accuracy as a system performance metric, it can be expected that accuracy will 
vary depending upon the type of orbit and satellite involved. For this reason, 
it is probably best to independently assess the accuracy of each specific 
satellite for which accuracy is a consideration. For more information on this 
topic, see my column titled <a href="/columns/v03n02/">"Real-World 
Benchmarking"</a> in <i>Satellite Times</i> Volume 3 Number 2.</p>

<p><a name="FAQ07"><i>How often are element sets generated?</i></a> New element 
sets are generated by NORAD on an as-needed basis rather than according to an 
established timetable. How often these updates occur depends upon a number of 
factors such as the orbit type or maneuvering capability of the satellite. For 
example, a satellite in low-earth orbit&mdash;such as the US space 
shuttle&mdash;would have its element sets updated several times a day because of 
the somewhat unpredictable results of atmospheric drag as it varies its attitude 
and the maneuvering being performed. A satellite in a low-drag orbit which 
doesn't maneuver&mdash;such as LAGEOS&nbsp;II&mdash;might only need updates once 
or twice a week. Objects such as rocket bodies, defunct payloads, or other space 
debris, won't be updated as frequently, either&mdash;unless there is a 
prediction of a close approach with an operational payload. Special-interest 
objects&mdash;such as a large object reentering the earth's 
atmosphere&mdash;normally get special treatment.</p>

<p><a name="FAQ08"><i>What is the reference frame of the resulting 
coordinates?</i></a> This question is a bit more technical than most we have 
covered. To be precise, the reference frame of the Earth-centered inertial (ECI) 
coordinates produced by the SGP4/SDP4 orbital model is true equator, mean 
equinox (TEME) of epoch.</p>

<p>In layman's terms, this simply means that the cartesian coordinates produced 
by the SGP4/SDP4 model have their <i>z</i> axis aligned with the true 
(instantaneous) North pole and the <i>x</i> axis aligned with the mean direction 
of the vernal equinox (accounting for precession but not nutation). This 
actually makes sense since the observations are collected from a network of 
sensors fixed to the earth's surface (and referenced to the true equator) but 
the position of the earth in inertial space (relative to the vernal equinox) 
must be estimated. For more details on this coordinate system, see my article on 
<a href="/columns/v02n01/">"Orbital Coordinate Systems, Part I"</a> in 
<i>Satellite Times</i> Volume 2 Number 1.</p>

<p><a name="FAQ09"><i>Are there two-line element sets for the moon and/or 
sun?</i></a> The short answer to this question is no. Assumptions made in the 
SGP4/SDP4 orbital model&mdash;made to reduce the computational burden of 
tracking thousands of earth satellites&mdash;are completely invalid when applied 
to other celestial bodies. Details on why this is so were covered in the 
January/February 1997 issue of this column titled&mdash;naturally 
enough&mdash;<a href="/columns/v03n03/">"Tracking the Sun and the Moon."</a> If 
you want to track the sun, moon, planets, or the latest comet, you're going to 
need to use an orbital model specifically designed to track these objects.</p>

<p><a name="FAQ10"><i>How do new satellite elements get added to the CelesTrak 
WWW?</i></a> Normally, all new objects are added to the master list as soon as 
the object is catalogued by NORAD. After 30 days have elapsed, elements are only 
maintained if someone requests that they be&mdash;otherwise, they are removed. 
At present, the master list contains a broad range of satellite element sets 
used by a large number of people around the world. It contains elements for 
various communications, navigation, weather, and other scientific satellites. 
Over the years, it has grown to include 300 satellite element sets.</p>

<p>The master list was originally intended as a single source of distribution 
back when this was originally done via the <i>Celestial BBS</i> and (later) the 
Usenet newsgroups. However, many users are interested in only a particular 
category of satellites for their applications, such as amateur radio satellites, 
and don't want a large list. As such, the <i>CelesTrak WWW</i> breaks out the 
satellite element sets into separate categorical lists to make it easier to find 
the elements of interest to you. Check out the <a 
href="/NORAD/elements/"><i>Current Data</i></a> section to see what lists are 
currently available.</p>

<p>In the future, the master list will probably be replaced with a list which 
contains only new objects catalogued within the past 30 days. All other elements 
will be contained within the individual categorical lists. Eventually, I hope to 
be able to provide users an option of defining their own list of elements to 
provide the ultimate in customization.</p>

<p><a name="FAQ11"><i>How does one find source code for the SGP4/SDP4 orbital 
models?</i></a> The primary source for the SGP4/SDP4 orbital models is found in 
<i>Spacetrack Report Number 3: Models for Propagation of NORAD Element Sets</i>. 
It contains the equations for most of the model along with the associated 
FORTRAN source code. This 
<a href="/NORAD/documentation/spacetrk.pdf">document</a> is available on the 
<i>CelesTrak WWW</i> in <i>Adobe Acrobat</i> Portable Document Format (PDF). The 
FORTRAN source code can be copied directly from this document and pasted into 
any text editor. There is also a 
<a href="/NORAD/documentation/spacetrk.zip">L<sup>A</sup>T<SUB>E</SUB>X 
version</a> online.</p>

<p>If you need source code in some language other than FORTRAN, you can also 
find a Pascal version of the complete SGP4/SDP4 orbital model on the CelesTrak 
WWW in my <a href="/software/satellite/sgp4-plb26a.zip"><i>SGP4 Pascal 
Library</i></a>. It contains not only the NORAD orbital model, but routines for 
doing various coordinate transformations and calculating the position of the 
sun. These routines were used to develop my 
<a href="/software/satellite/trakstar26a.zip"><i>TrakStar</i></a> 
program&mdash;a simple program intended to show how easy it is to use the 
library but often used as a standalone analysis tool. While I still plan to 
produce a C version of this code, I have not had time to do this yet and I know 
of no publicly-available C version which contains both the SGP4 <i>and</i> SDP4 
orbital models.</p>

<p><a name="FAQ12"><i>How does one obtain historical element sets?</i></a> As of 
mid-January 1998, there is now an <a href="/NORAD/archives/request.php">online 
form</a> on the <i>CelesTrak WWW</i> to request historical two-line element 
sets. Current archives run from January 1980 through the present and contain 
over ten million two-line element sets. Those historical element sets which are 
requested frequently are kept online in the 
<a href="/NORAD/archives/"><i>Historical Archives</i></a> section. However, it 
is impossible to keep all of the current archives&mdash;over 1.5 gigabytes of 
data&mdash;online. If you have a need for historical data which cannot be found 
online, please use this form (found at the bottom of the main <i>Historical 
Archives</i> page) to request the data you need.</p>

<p><a name="FAQ13"><i>Where does one find a list of satellite 
frequencies?</i></a> The best source of information on satellite downlink 
frequencies that I've seen can be found on <i>Launchspace.com</i> in their 
<i>Reference</i> section. It contains a list of over 600 downlink frequencies in 
the range of 3 MHz to 32 GHz covering everything from satellites to NASA support 
aircraft <i>[Launchspace no longer carries this list of satellite frequencies. 
If I find another source, I'll include it here.]</i>.</p>

<p><a name="CORRECTION"><i>Correction:</i></a> In my last column (<a 
href="/columns/v04n03/">"Frequently Asked Questions: Two-Line Element Set 
Format"</a> <i>Satellite Times</i> Volume 4 Number 3), I suggested that the 
format for fields 1.10 and 1.11 owed its heritage to the FORTRAN programming 
language. Instead, as one of our readers pointed out, it originated with the 
Philco 2000/Model 212 and the TAC assembly language used on the original 496L 
system. The FORTRAN language just happens to follow the same convention.</p>

<p>Few aspects of the Space Age have had as much impact on our everyday lives as 
the invention of the communications satellite. In just a few short decades, they 
have brought together even the most far-flung reaches of the globe in ways that 
not that long ago were barely imaginable. In fact, today it is possible to talk 
directly to climbers at the top of Mount Everest or communicate via the Internet 
with virtually any computer system on the face of the planet&mdash;all with the 
help of communications satellites.</p>

<p>While communications satellites perform their missions in many types of 
orbits, from near-earth constellations like Iridium and Globalstar to the 
highly-inclined, eccentric Molniya orbits used by the Russian Federation, one of 
the more important classes of orbits for these satellites is the geostationary 
orbit. In this column, I'd like to examine the unique aspects of this class of 
orbit which make it suitable for not only satellite communications, but early 
warning and weather observations, too.</p>

<p><b>History</b></p>

<p>The concept of the geostationary orbit has been around since the early part 
of the twentieth century. Apparently, the concept was originated by Russian 
theorist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky&mdash;who wrote numerous science and 
science-fiction articles on space travel at the turn of the century. In the 1920s, 
Hermann Oberth and Herman Potocnik&mdash;perhaps better known by his pseudonym, 
Herman Noordung&mdash;wrote about space stations which maintained a unique 
vantage over the earth.<a href="#NOTE1"><small><sup>1</sup></small></a> Each 
author described an orbit at an altitude of 35,900 kilometers whose period 
exactly matched the earth's rotational period, making it appear to hover over a 
fixed point on the earth's equator.</p>

<p>However, the person most widely given credit for the concept of using this 
orbit for communications is Arthur C. Clarke. In an article he published in 
<i>Wireless World</i> in October 1945 titled "Extra-Terrestrial Relays: Can 
Rocket Stations Give World-wide Radio Coverage?" Clarke extrapolates from the 
German rocket research of the time to a day when communications around the world 
would be possible via a network of three geostationary satellites spaced at 
equal intervals around the earth's equator (see Figure 1).</p>

<p class=center><img class=auto alt="Figure 1" src="fig-1.gif" width=535 height=185"></p>

<p class=center><b>Figure 1. Original figure from Clarke's article in the 
October 1945 edition of Wireless World</b><a href="#NOTE2"><small><sup>2</sup></small></a></p>

<p>In this article, Clarke not only determines the orbital characteristics 
necessary for such an orbit, but also discusses the frequencies and power needed 
for communications to and from space and how to use solar illumination for 
power&mdash;he even calculates the impact of solar eclipses around the vernal 
and autumnal equinoxes. What makes this article all the more remarkable is that 
Clarke wrote it more than a dozen years before the first satellite was even 
launched.</p>

<p>It wasn't until 1963 that NASA set out to test Clarke's concept with the 
Synchronous Communications Satellite program. Unfortunately, Syncom 
1&mdash;launched 1963 February 14&mdash;while successfully reaching geosynchronous 
orbit in an inclined, eccentric orbit was unsuccessful due to an electronics 
failure. Syncom 2&mdash;launched 1963 July 26&mdash;became the first operational 
geosynchronous communications satellite. Syncom 3&mdash;launched 1964 August 
19&mdash;became the first geostationary satellite, finally fulfilling the 
prediction made by Clarke almost twenty years earlier.</p>

<p><b>Theory</b></p>

<p>So just what is a geostationary orbit? In general terms, it is a special 
orbit for which any satellite in that orbit will appear to hover stationary over 
a point on the earth's surface. Unlike all other classes of orbits, however, 
where there can be a family of orbits, there is only one geostationary orbit. 
Let's examine this orbit's unique characteristics.</p>

<p>For any orbit to be geostationary, it must first be geosynchronous. A 
geosynchronous orbit is any orbit which has a period equal to the earth's 
rotational period. As we shall soon see, this requirement is not sufficient to 
ensure a fixed position relative to the earth. While all geostationary orbits 
must be geosynchronous, not all geosynchronous orbits are geostationary. 
Unfortunately, these terms are often used interchangeably. </p>

<p>Before continuing, it is necessary to clarify what is meant by "the earth's 
rotational period." For most timekeeping, we consider the earth's rotation to be 
measured relative to the sun's (mean) position. However, since the sun moves 
relative to the stars (inertial space) as a result of the earth's orbit, one 
mean solar day is not the rotational period that we're interested in. A 
geosynchronous satellite completes one orbit around the earth in the same time 
that it takes the earth to make one rotation in inertial (or fixed) space. This 
time period is known as one sidereal day and is equivalent to 
23<sup>h</sup>56<sup>m</sup>04<sup>s</sup> of mean solar time (for more 
information, see <a href="/columns/v02n01/">"Orbital Coordinate Systems, Part 
I"</a> in the September/October 1995 issue of <i>Satellite Times</i>). Without 
any other influences, the earth will be oriented the same way in inertial space 
each time a satellite with this period returns to a particular point in its 
orbit.</p>

<p>To ensure that a satellite remains over a particular point on the earth's 
surface, the orbit must also be circular and have zero inclination. Figure 2 
shows the difference between a geostationary orbit (GSO) and a geosynchronous 
orbit (GEO) with an inclination of 20 degrees. Both are circular orbits. While 
each satellite will complete its orbit in the same time it takes the earth to 
rotate once, it should be obvious that the geosynchronous satellite will move 
north and south of the equator during its orbit while the geostationary 
satellite will not.</p>

<p class=center><img class=auto alt="Figure 2" src="fig-2.gif" width=630" height=300></p>

<p class=center><b>Figure 2. Geostationary and Geosynchronous Orbits</b></p>

<p>Orbits with non-zero eccentricity (i.e., elliptical rather than circular 
orbits) will result in drifts east and west as the satellite goes faster or 
slower at various points in its orbit. Combinations of non-zero inclination and 
eccentricity will all result in movement relative to a fixed ground point.</p>

<p>Figure 3 shows some typical results. The figure-eight ground track is that of 
the geosynchronous orbit (GEO) shown in Figure 2. The geostationary satellite 
(GSO) sits fixed at the crossover point of the figure eight (over the equator). 
If we now give the geosynchronous satellite an eccentricity of 0.10, the slanted 
teardrop shape results. Typically, eccentric geosynchronous orbits will result 
in a slanted figure eight&mdash;this one just happens to have the crossover 
point at the northern apex of the ground track.</p>

<p class=center><img class=auto alt="Figure 3" src="fig-3.gif" width=630 height=400></p>

<p class=center><b>Figure 3. Geosynchronous Ground Tracks</b></p>

<p>It should now be apparent that only satellites which orbit with a period 
equal to the earth's rotational period and with zero eccentricity and 
inclination can be geostationary satellites. As such, there is only one 
geostationary orbit&mdash;a belt circling the earth's equator at an altitude of 
roughly 35,786 kilometers.</p>

<p>It should also be clear that it is not possible to orbit a satellite which is 
stationary over a point which is not on the equator. This limitation is not 
serious, however, since most of the earth's surface is visible from 
geostationary orbit. In fact, a single geostationary satellite can see 42 
percent of the earth's surface and a constellation of geostationary 
satellites&mdash;like the one Clarke suggested&mdash;can see all of the earth's 
surface between 81&deg;&nbsp;S and 81&deg;&nbsp;N.</p>

<p>Of course, the advantage of a satellite in a geostationary orbit is that it 
remains stationary relative to the earth's surface. This makes it an ideal orbit 
for communications since it will not be necessary to track the satellite to 
determine where to point an antenna. However, there are some disadvantages. 
Perhaps the first is the long distance between the satellite and the ground. 
With sufficient power or a large enough antenna, though, this limitation can be 
overcome.</p>

<p>The fact that there is only one geostationary orbit presents a more serious 
limitation. Just as in putting beads on a loop of string, there are only so many 
slots into which geostationary satellites can be placed. The primary limitation 
here is spacing satellites along the geostationary belt so that the limited 
frequencies allocated to this purpose don't result in interference between 
satellites on uplink or downlink. Of course, we also want to make sure the 
satellites aren't close enough to run into one another since they will have some 
small movement.</p>

<p>While new communications satellites may be placed in a true geostationary 
orbit initially, there are several forces which act to alter their orbits over 
time. Since the geostationary orbital plane is not coincident with the plane of 
the earth's orbit (the ecliptic) or that of the moon's orbit, the gravitational 
attraction of the sun and the moon act to pull the geostationary satellites out 
of their equatorial orbit, gradually increasing each satellite's orbital 
inclination. In addition, the noncircular shape of the earth's equator causes 
these satellites to be slowly drawn to one of two stable equilibrium points 
along the equator, resulting in an east-west libration (drifting back and forth) 
about these points.</p>

<p>To counteract these perturbations, sufficient fuel is loaded into all 
geostationary satellites to periodically correct any changes over the planned 
lifetime of the satellite. These periodic corrections are known as 
stationkeeping. North-south stationkeeping corrects the slowly increasing 
inclination back to zero and east-west stationkeeping keeps the satellite at its 
assigned position within the geostationary belt. These maneuvers are planned to 
maintain the geostationary satellite within a small distance of its ideal 
location (both north-south and east-west). This tolerance is normally designed 
to ensure the satellite remains within the ground antenna beamwidth without 
tracking.</p>

<p>Once the satellite has exhausted its fuel, its inclination will begin to grow 
and it will begin to drift in longitude and may present a threat to other 
geostationary satellites. Oftentimes, geostationary satellites are boosted into 
a slightly higher orbit at the end of their planned lifetime to prevent them 
causing havoc with other geostationary satellites. This final maneuver assumes 
that no unplanned failure has occurred which would prevent it (such as a power 
or communications failure).</p>

<p><b>Summary</b></p>

<p>This initial article on geostationary and geosynchronous orbits should give 
you a basic understanding of some of the fundamental orbital concepts. In our 
next column, I would like to continue this topic by examining the relationship 
among the observer, satellite, and the sun to determine a geostationary 
satellite's longitude, the look angles from a terrestrial observer, and how the 
position of the sun can affect onboard power management and interference with 
satellite communications.</p>

<p>In our last column, we discussed the basics of the geostationary orbit, 
describing the unique characteristics which make this particular orbit so 
valuable. In this issue, I would like to cover some operational considerations 
which can be important when working with satellites in these orbits. In 
particular, I would like to discuss how to determine the location of a 
geostationary satellite&mdash;relative to the earth's surface and any observer 
on its surface&mdash;and how the sun's position can affect onboard power 
management and communications.</p>

<p><b>Locating Geostationary Satellites</b></p>

<p>Ease of tracking&mdash;or, rather the lack of tracking&mdash;is one of the 
primary characteristics of the geostationary orbit which make it so valuable. An 
observer on the ground can simply point an antenna toward a fixed point in space 
and then forget it&mdash;no tracking is required. However, before the antenna 
can be pointed, the observer must first determine where the satellite is 
located.</p>

<p>As we saw in our series on orbital coordinate systems (in the 
<a href="/columns/v02n01/">September/October 1995</a>, 
<a href="/columns/v02n02/">November/December 1995</a>, and 
<a href="/columns/v02n03/">January/February 1996</a> issues of <i>Satellite 
Times</i>), the first step to determining the location of a satellite relative 
to an observer is to determine both the satellite and observer's position in the 
same coordinate system. For this development, we are going to use the 
<i>Earth-Centered Fixed (ECF)</i> coordinate system&mdash;latitude, longitude, 
and radius (or altitude)&mdash;as our common coordinate system.</p>

<p>As it turns out, one of the common ways of expressing a geostationary 
satellite's position is to specify its longitude&mdash;that is, the longitude on 
the equator over which the satellite appears to hover. This information can be 
obtained from various sources including the "Geostationary Satellite Locator 
Guide" found in every issue of Satellite Times. This guide is generated using 
the latest two-line element sets and determines each satellite's longitude at 
its ascending node.</p>

<p>For the satellite to be geostationary, of course, its latitude must be zero 
and its altitude must be 35,786 kilometers (for this development, we will assume 
a true geostationary orbit and a spherical earth). Knowing the longitude of the 
satellite and the latitude and longitude of the observer, we can now determine 
where to look.</p>

<p>If <i>R</i> is the radius of the earth, <i>r</i> is the geostationary 
altitude, &lambda; is the satellite's longitude, &theta; is the observer's 
longitude, and &phi; is the observer's latitude, then the satellite and 
observer's ECF positions are:</p>

	  <tr>
	    <td align=center width=150><i>Satellite</i></td>

  <tbody>
	  <tr>
	    <td align=center><i>S<sub>x</sub></i> = (<i>R</i>+<i>r</i>) cos &lambda;</td>
	    <td align=center><i>O<sub>x</sub></i> = <i>R</i> cos &phi; cos &theta;</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td align=center><i>S<sub>y</sub></i> = (<i>R</i>+<i>r</i>) sin &lambda;</td>

	    <td align=center><i>O<sub>z</sub></i> = <i>R</i> sin &phi;</td>
	  </tr>
  </tbody>

<br>
<p>and the range vector is the satellite's position minus the observer's
position:</p>

<br>
<p>To calculate azimuth and elevation, we use the same coordinate transformation 
described in <a href="/columns/v02n02/">"Orbital Coordinate Systems, Part II"</a>
in the November/December 1995 issue of <i>Satellite Times</i>. As an example, 
let's calculate the position of Galaxy 4 from Pasadena, California.</p>

<div style="overflow-x: auto;">
<table class="center outline striped" style="min-width=450px;" cellpadding=5>
	<thead>
	  <tr class=header>
	    <td class=center width=150><i>Constants</i></td>
	    <td class=center width=150><i>Satellite</i></td>
	    <td class=center width=150><i>Observer</i></td>
	  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
	  <tr>
	    <td class=center><i>R</i> = 6,378 km</td>
	    <td class=center>&lambda; = 99.0&deg;W</td>
	    <td class=center>&phi; = 34.15&deg;N</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td class=center><i>r</i> = 35,786 km</td>
	    <td class=center>&nbsp;</td>
	    <td class=center>&theta; = 118.15&deg;W</td>
	  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>
<br>
<p>Using these values yields an azimuth to the satellite of 148.25&deg;, an 
elevation of 45.32&deg;, and a range of 37,390 km&mdash;values pretty close to 
the true values.</p>

<p>While this approach can be used to produce good estimates, these are probably 
not calculations you would want to do by hand (although they can be done fairly 
easily using a spreadsheet). Plus, if you do not know the satellite's longitude, 
you will need to start from the satellite's orbital elements, further 
complicating the process. Of course, you can use a program like <i>TrakStar</i> 
to calculate the latitude, longitude, and altitude or the look angles (azimuth, 
elevation, and range) of any satellite (geostationary or otherwise) for any time 
interval desired using two-line element sets found on the <i>CelesTrak</i> WWW 
site.</p>

<p><b>Power Management Issues</b></p>

<p>Geostationary orbits present some interesting challenges for power 
management. To understand these challenges, we must first understand a little 
about the attitude (orientation in space) of geostationary satellites and the 
position of the geostationary orbit relative to the sun.</p>

<p>All modern geostationary spacecraft use one of two forms of stabilization to 
maintain their attitude: dual-spin or three-axis stabilization (see Figure 1). 
With dual-spin stabilization, the satellite takes the shape of a cylinder which 
rotates about its long axis. This type of satellite has two sections: a spinning 
section upon which the solar arrays are mounted and a despun section where the 
communications antennas are mounted. The spinning section provides basic 
stabilization and can rotate as fast as 100 RPM (in the case of the early GOES 
satellites). The despun section rotates, too, albeit at a much slower rate of 
one rotation per orbit (day)&mdash;keeping the antennas pointed at the earth and 
preventing the satellite from going into a flat spin (which is the natural 
tendency).</p>

<p class=center><a href="fig-1.gif"><img class=auto alt="Figure 1" src="fig-1a.gif" width=400 height=300></a></p>

<p class=center><b>Figure 1. Geostationary Spacecraft Attitude Types</b></p>

<p>With three-axis stabilization, the spacecraft attitude is maintained through 
the use of momentum wheels or control moment gyros. The body of the spacecraft 
does rotate once per orbit (day) to keep the antennas pointed at the earth. The 
solar arrays are mounted on paddles which also rotate once per day to keep them 
pointed toward the sun.</p>

<p>In both cases, it should be noted that the rotation axis of the satellite is 
perpendicular to the satellite's orbital plane&mdash;which for geostationary 
orbits is the equatorial plane. We will see why this is important shortly.</p>

<p>As with all satellites, the solar arrays on geostationary satellites are 
subject to a number factors which can result in significant fluctuations in the 
amount of power available to onboard systems. To begin with, the position of the 
satellite relative to the sun varies throughout the year. As the earth goes 
around its orbit, its distance from the sun changes from a minimum of 0.983 
astronomical units (AUs&mdash;the mean distance from the earth to the sun is 
approximately 1 AU or 149,597,871 km) to a maximum of 1.0167 AU&mdash;a 
difference of 4,999,627 km. If we consider the energy received from the sun at 
1 AU to be 100%, then the energy received varies from 97% to 103%, as shown in 
Figure 2.</p>

<p class=center><a href="fig-2.gif"><img class=auto alt="Figure 2" src="fig-2a.gif" width=455 height=311"></a></p>

<p class=center><b>Figure 2. Solar Distance Efficiency</b></p>

<p>Not only isn't the earth's orbit truly circular, but the plane of the earth's 
equator does not lie in the plane of the earth's orbit (the ecliptic). Earth's 
seasons are a direct result of this circumstance. From our vantage on earth, it 
appears that the sun slowly moves from 23&deg; below the equatorial plane (at 
the winter solstice) to 23&deg; above the equatorial plane (at the summer 
solstice) and back again over the course of a year. As seen in Figure 3, our 
geostationary satellite sees the same thing.</p>

<p class=center><a href="fig-3.gif"><img class=auto alt="Figure 3" src="fig-3a.gif" width=400 height=300></a></p>

<p class=center><b>Figure 3. Sun-Earth-Satellite Geometry</b></p>

<p>The apparent motion of the sun above and below the equatorial plane has two 
effects. First, it changes the angle of incidence of solar energy received on 
the solar arrays since they must rotate about an axis perpendicular to the 
equatorial plane. As a result, the amount of solar energy absorbed by the solar 
arrays drops off as a factor of cos(&delta;), where &delta; is the sun's 
declination (angle relative to the equatorial plane). If we consider the amount 
of energy received when the sun's rays are perpendicular to the solar arrays to 
be 100%, then the energy received drops to less than 92% at the solstices, as 
shown in Figure 4.</p>

<p class=center><a href="fig-4.gif"><img class=auto alt="Figure 4" src="fig-4a.gif" width=455 height=311"></a></p>

<p class=center><b>Figure 4. Solar Angle Efficiency</b></p>

<p>From Figure 3 we can also see that because of this sun-earth geometry, the 
geostationary orbit is usually outside the cone of the earth's shadow. That is, 
until around the times of the vernal and autumnal equinoxes (the beginning of 
spring and fall). At these times, geostationary satellites enter their eclipse 
season, when they can spend as much as 70 minutes of every day in shadow. These 
seasons run from the end of February through the middle of April and the 
beginning of September through the middle of October. The percentage of sunlight 
received for geostationary satellites is shown in Figure 5. To prepare for 
eclipse seasons, the satellite operators must ensure that the spacecraft 
batteries are properly conditioned to pick up the load during each day's 
eclipse.</p>

<p class=center><a href="fig-5.gif"><img class=auto alt="Figure 5" src="fig-5a.gif" width=455 height=311"></a></p>

<p class=center><b>Figure 5. Eclipse Efficiency</b></p>

<p>If we combine the effects of variations in solar distance, solar angle, and 
eclipses over the course of a year, we get the result in Figure 6. As can be 
seen in this figure, total solar energy available varies 12%&mdash;from a low of 89% 
to a high of 101%.</p>

<p class=center><a href="fig-6.gif"><img class=auto alt="Figure 6" src="fig-6a.gif" width=455 height=311"></a></p>

<p class=center><b>Figure 6. Total Annual Efficiency</b></p>

<p>If we also factor in the effects of degradation on the solar cells and their 
optical coverings due to the space environment and look at a nominal seven-year 
satellite lifetime, we get the graph in Figure 7. Typical results show the 
optical covering degrades about 7% the first year before stabilizing while the 
solar cells degrade about 3% their first year and 2% each subsequent year. As 
can be seen from the graph, the power levels drop from a high of 99% overall 
efficiency to a low of 72%. When designing the spacecraft power subsystem, that 
means if 7.5 kW of power are required for normal operations, the power subsystem 
must be designed to provide almost 10kW initially so that available power 
doesn't drop below the threshold before the end of the planned satellite 
lifetime.</p>

<p class=center><a href="fig-7.gif"><img class=auto alt="Figure 7" src="fig-7a.gif" width=455 height=311"></a></p>

<p class=center><b>Figure 7. Total Lifetime Efficiency</b></p>

<p><b>Solar Interference</b></p>

<p>In addition to planning for variations in spacecraft power, satellite 
operators and users also need to plan for communications outages (or 
degradation) around the eclipse seasons. As the sun sweeps across the sky each 
day and gradually moves north or south with the seasons, there will come a time 
twice each year when the sun is directly behind a geostationary satellite as 
seen from a ground-based antenna. When this happens, the flood of solar radio 
energy into the antenna's main lobe can severely disrupt communications. 
Fortunately, such disruptions only last a couple of minutes. You may have 
actually seen one of these outages while watching your favorite cable channel 
(most of which are transmitted via geostationary satellites). For observers in 
the Northern Hemisphere, this happens prior to vernal equinox and after the 
autumnal equinox.</p>

<p>We covered a lot of ground in this article&mdash;orbital mechanics, 
spacecraft attitude, power management, and even materials&mdash;all factors 
important in the design and operation of any satellite, but particularly 
important for geostationary satellites. I hope I've shown how these various 
areas interact and overlap and, in the process, shed some light on the topic of 
spacecraft design. As always, if you have any questions, please feel free to
